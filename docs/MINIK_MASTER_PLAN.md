# MINIK — MASTER PRODUCT, ARCHITECTURE & DELIVERY PLAN

**Canonical handoff document for ChatGPT, Codex, and future development sessions**
**Snapshot date: 2026-08-31**
**Document status: v2 — canonical baseline plus the user-confirmed Ping Pong product decision and implementation sprint**
**Repository path:** `ios/docs/MINIK_MASTER_PLAN.md`

---

## 0. Why this document exists

This file is the single long-form source of truth for finishing Minik on iPhone/iPad. It exists so a new ChatGPT session, a new Codex session, or another engineer can understand the product without reconstructing months of conversation.

It intentionally contains four kinds of information:

1. **What the Android application actually is today** — because Android is the behavioral/content/product reference for the language product and for shared product systems.
2. **What the iOS products are supposed to become** — including Minik Math, which does **not** exist on Android and therefore must not be reverse-engineered from Android Math code that does not exist.
3. **What has already been implemented in iOS as of 2026-08-30** — including known limitations and branch/commit state.
4. **The complete execution plan to release** — architecture, sprints, Definition of Done, App Store work, ads, remove-ads, Firebase records, progress, parent area, localization, artwork, testing, TestFlight, and release.

### 0.1 Mandatory rule for future sessions

Before changing production code, a new ChatGPT/Codex session must read this document completely, then inspect the current repository state. It must **not** replace confirmed product requirements with guesses.

### 0.2 Protection rule for this file

Sections marked **CANONICAL PRODUCT CONTRACT** may only be changed when the user explicitly changes a product requirement or when a verified Android fact is corrected. Codex may update the **Living Status**, **Sprint Status**, **Decision Log**, and **Sprint Log** after each sprint without deleting the explanatory product sections.

### 0.3 Status vocabulary

- **VERIFIED ANDROID:** observed in the supplied Android snapshot/source/resources.
- **USER-CONFIRMED:** explicitly required by the product owner.
- **IMPLEMENTED iOS:** production code exists in the current iOS work.
- **STATICALLY REVIEWED:** code was independently inspected/parsed where possible, but not compiled in Xcode.
- **MAC VALIDATION PENDING:** requires Xcode/XCTest/Simulator on macOS.
- **OPEN PRODUCT DECISION:** must be answered by the user; Android cannot decide it.
- **RELEASE BLOCKER:** required before shipping.

# PART I — CANONICAL PRODUCT CONTRACT

## 1. Product model

### 1.1 The products

There are two educational product outcomes:

1. **Minik Language** — currently represented in iOS by the `MinikPlus` target/code name.
2. **Minik Math** — a separate math-learning product sharing the same engines, shell, design system, infrastructure, rewards, settings, parent area, commerce, and backend where appropriate.

There is also a language policy variant:

3. **Minik Plus English / English Only** — not a third architecture. It is the same Language product with policy differences: learned language fixed to English; no learned-language selector; Hebrew interface locale excluded while other supported interface locales remain available.

There is also a fourth, intentionally non-educational product:

4. **Minik Ping Pong** — a standalone Ping-Pong-only app using the same game engine and future shared monetization services, but no Language or Math curriculum.

Current XcodeGen configuration has four iOS targets:

- `MinikPlus`
- `MinikPlusEnglish`
- `MinikMath`
- `MinikPingPong`

The codebase must remain shared. Do not duplicate activity engines per product.

### 1.2 Platform authority

**USER-CONFIRMED:**

- Android is the behavioral/content/product reference for **Language** and for shared Minik systems that already exist there.
- Android contains **no Math product**. Do not search Android for a Math curriculum or assume Android defines Math activity behavior.
- Minik Math is intentionally freer: reuse the proven activity families and child-friendly Minik identity, but define mathematical content cleanly and systematically for iOS.
- Native Apple conventions take precedence over Android presentation only when they improve iPhone/iPad layout, accessibility, navigation, lifecycle, safe areas, controls, gestures, Dynamic Type, or RTL without changing the educational/product contract.
- `ios/docs/android-known-fixes.md` overrides known Android snapshot bugs.

### 1.3 Fundamental Math rule

**USER-CONFIRMED, NON-NEGOTIABLE:**

> **Level = WHAT the child is learning. Activity = HOW the child practices it.**

A Math activity must not silently fall back to an easier level's content just because that activity engine is easier to implement.

Example:

- A Level 1 visual-choice activity may show five strawberries and ask for `5`.
- The same activity at a higher level may show `30 ÷ 6` and ask for `5`.
- Soccer remains Soccer; Tower remains Tower. The educational content inside them changes with the level.

### 1.4 Ping-Pong-only product contract

**USER-CONFIRMED 2026-08-31:**

- `ProductVariant.minikPingPong`, Xcode target/product `MinikPingPong`, and compilation condition `MINIK_PING_PONG` define the fourth product.
- It launches directly into a minimal Ping Pong shell rather than an educational activity hub.
- It contains Ping Pong gameplay, score, win/loss result, difficulty, applicable control-mode selection, and match-target selection.
- It contains no Language curriculum, Math curriculum, learned-language state, Parent Area, or educational activity hub.
- Future Remove Ads, “I have a code,” and interstitial behavior must use the shared app-level Ads/commerce/code systems. The game may only report completed-match opportunities; it must never implement or fake its own purchase, entitlement, ad, or redemption success.
- Interstitial opportunities are allowed only between completed matches, never during serve, rally, or point resolution. Cadence is configurable; the provisional cadence is every two completed matches, and a future Remove Ads entitlement suppresses them.

---

## 2. What the Android application actually contains

The supplied Android snapshot includes, among others:

- `MainActivity.kt`
- `IntroScreen.kt`
- `ButtonsMenuFragment.kt`
- `LanguagesAndLevelsDialogFragment.kt`
- `LearnScreen.kt`
- `LetterPairsFragment.kt`
- `WriteScreen.kt`
- `RandomWordCardsFragment.kt`
- `LettersSoccerGame.kt`
- `LettersTowerFragment.kt`
- `MemoryGameFragment.kt`
- `TicTacToeFragment.kt`
- `StatisticsDialog.kt`
- `RecordsLeaderboardDialogFragment.kt`
- `RemoveAdsReminderFragment.kt`
- `InterstitialHelper.kt`
- `SharedPreferencesCache.kt`
- `TextToSpeechManager.kt`
- `UserLanguageManager.kt`
- `ConfettiRectView.kt`
- corresponding phone/tablet layouts and localized strings.

This is a full child-facing product, not a collection of isolated exercise sessions.

The companion [Android UI reference index](reference/android-ui/README.md) describes 16 repository screenshots covering representative Language activities, games, menus, mascot/feedback presentation, navigation, scores/records, and Parent Area. The owner's 2026-09-06 gate makes every image a binding Language/shared visual reference together with Android layout/source/assets; all known source discrepancies must be addressed before source-parity completion.

### 2.1 Android home/product shell

**VERIFIED ANDROID + USER-CONFIRMED screenshots:**

The Plus product has a colorful Minik shell with:

- Minik/MinikPlus branding and mascot artwork.
- Home navigation.
- Trophy/records/high-score access.
- Points and record/streak display.
- Sectioned activity cards.
- Language/level/settings access.
- Parent/settings area.
- Advertising/removal entry points when applicable.
- Child-friendly success/failure presentation and mascot reactions.

The iOS product must provide the same product breadth with a native SwiftUI implementation rather than reproducing Android XML literally.

### 2.2 The 13 Android-visible Language production activities

**USER-CONFIRMED canonical inventory:**

1. **Letters Review / Learn Letters** — instructional; letter/examples/images and speech.
2. **Letter Pairs** — 8 pictures / 4 pairs; pair pictured words sharing the same starting letter; tapping speaks; correct pair disappears/scores.
3. **First Letter — picture → letter** — image then choose the first letter.
4. **First Letter reverse — letter → picture** — letter then choose the image whose word starts with it.
5. **Picture → Word** — image plus four learned-word answers.
6. **Word → Picture** — learned word plus four image answers.
7. **Build Word** — construct the word; correctness follows ordered construction rules.
8. **Mixed** — cycles multiple exercise types according to the production cadence/capability policy.
9. **Word Cards / Flash Cards** — learned words presented sequentially with speech, shuffle/manual/timed behavior, looping.
10. **Soccer** — word construction through soccer actions; educational correctness and shot outcome are separate.
11. **Tower / Alphabet Blocks** — build a word from ordered letter blocks into a tower.
12. **Pictures Memory** — picture ↔ identical picture; revealing a card speaks the learned word.
13. **Tic-Tac-Toe** — just for fun; not a language exercise.

Generic helper engines such as generic Choose/Build/Pairs/Memory may exist internally, but they do **not** count as additional production activities.

### 2.3 Confirmed detailed Android mechanics already migrated/reviewed

#### Picture Memory

- Two physical picture cards share the same semantic content identity.
- It is picture↔picture, not picture↔word.
- Revealing a picture speaks the represented learned-language word.
- Correct matching is semantic, not physical-card identity.
- Math Memory remains silent unless Math explicitly defines narration.

#### Mixed

Normal production cadence already established:

- 20 Word → Picture
- 10 Picture → Word
- 5 Word Build
- repeat

The iOS migration counts real challenge advances rather than reproducing Android counter quirks.

#### Language Soccer

Confirmed contract:

- The educational action is choosing/kicking the next correct letter of the target word.
- Correct letter advances the word even if the shot misses/is saved.
- Wrong letter never advances/consumes.
- Duplicate letters are distinct physical balls but semantically interchangeable when the token matches.
- Score matrix:
  - correct + goal → child +1
  - correct + miss/saved → nobody
  - wrong + goal → nobody
  - wrong + miss/saved → keeper +1
- Continuous practice across words.
- Target word spoken at round start; kicked letter spoken using correct pronunciation metadata, including Hebrew final forms.
- Math Soccer follows the same score matrix, but its educational content is numeric/math rather than letters.

#### Language Tower

Confirmed Android behavior:

- First letter is locked as the base.
- Remaining letters are draggable.
- Only the next expected semantic letter is accepted.
- Wrong near-target placement gives failure feedback but does not consume/advance.
- Whitespace is not draggable and is inserted automatically in the built display.
- Correct letter is spoken; completed word is spoken.
- Continuous next-word practice for the relevant Plus path.

#### Tic-Tac-Toe

Confirmed Android production behavior:

- Standard 3×3 board; 8 winning lines; full no-winner board = draw.
- Child starts every round whether choosing X or O.
- Mark choice locks after the first move and unlocks next round while retaining selection.
- A/B/C/D/E/Random/Adaptive difficulty behavior exists.
- Easy random empty; Medium uses prioritized win/block/center/corner/edge with level probabilities; Hard is minimax and unbeatable.
- Plus Games path loops rounds until explicit exit; hidden cumulative score is retained internally.
- Result messages, speech, animations, confetti/timing and intro gating exist.
- Human moves use one of two kick sounds; AI move silent.
- Android has a live Random/Adaptive DDA mismatch; iOS isolates that behind a compatibility policy rather than spreading it through the game.

### 2.4 Audio and speech

**VERIFIED ANDROID + USER-CONFIRMED:**

- Android uses TTS extensively.
- Some activities speak an instructional/target item on entry or when a new round begins.
- Many screens have an explicit speaker/replay button.
- Correct letter/word speech can be part of the interaction.
- Hosting/interface language and learned language are different concerns.
- iOS must preserve this separation. Learned vocabulary speech must not be tied to the UI locale, and UI/game feedback must not misuse the learned-language TTS service.

### 2.5 Success/failure feedback, Minik, points and streaks

**VERIFIED ANDROID + USER-CONFIRMED screenshots:**

The product includes more than correct/incorrect text:

- Minik mascot reactions/poses.
- Success animations.
- Confetti in appropriate contexts.
- Positive spoken phrases.
- Failure/encouragement feedback.
- Points.
- Current streak / record streak concepts.
- Record/high-score presentation.
- Level-up/achievement-style feedback.

The iOS architecture must emit shared activity-result/reward events so every activity participates consistently instead of reimplementing scoring/rewards ad hoc.

### 2.6 Progress and statistics

**VERIFIED ANDROID:**

Android includes a `StatisticsDialog`, saved user state in shared preferences, points, level/ramp state, activity performance data, and records UI. The exact Android persistence schema is not automatically the desired iOS schema, but the user-facing capabilities must be accounted for.

Required iOS outcome:

- local durable progress state;
- per-product/per-profile curriculum progress;
- activity attempts/correctness;
- practice time where appropriate;
- points/streak/records;
- parent-readable progress summary;
- backend sync for the records features that are meant to be shared/global.

### 2.7 Records / leaderboard / Firebase

**VERIFIED ANDROID + USER-CONFIRMED:**

Android initializes Firebase/App Check and has a records/leaderboard dialog with score/streak categories. The product owner explicitly requires records/high scores to be preserved with Firebase-backed behavior.

Required iOS architecture:

- backend interface owned by the app layer, not by activity sessions;
- Firebase implementation for Minik records/leaderboards and any confirmed sync data;
- local cache/offline-safe behavior;
- child/privacy-safe identity model;
- App Check where supported/required by the backend;
- no activity directly calling Firebase.

Do not assume every Android Firebase analytics event must be copied blindly. Analytics/privacy policy must be reviewed under current Apple child-app rules before release.

### 2.8 Parent Area / settings

**USER-CONFIRMED + VERIFIED ANDROID layouts/source:**

The iOS Parent Area must ultimately include the relevant equivalents of:

- learned language selection for Minik Language;
- no learned-language choice in English Only (English fixed);
- app/interface language selection;
- reading/skill/level controls where applicable;
- Math level controls;
- encouragement/reminder toggle(s);
- progress/statistics view;
- points/high score/streak/records access;
- remove-ads purchase/restore controls;
- other adult-only links/actions behind an appropriate parental gate if the App Store child category requires it.

### 2.9 Ads and Remove Ads

**VERIFIED ANDROID + USER-CONFIRMED:**

Android contains:

- interstitial ad flow;
- ad counters/skip logic;
- remove-ads purchase entry;
- remove-ads reminder UI;
- layout behavior that changes when ads are present/removed.

Required iOS outcome:

- provider boundary around ads;
- clearly defined display policy/events rather than ad calls inside activity code;
- purchase entitlement removes ads immediately and persistently;
- restore purchases;
- reminder cadence/state;
- no child-targeted/behavioral advertising if prohibited by the selected App Store category/policy;
- parental gating for purchasing/external links where required.

**APPLE POLICY CHECKPOINT (verified 2026-08-30 against Apple documentation):** if Minik is submitted in the Kids Category, purchasing opportunities/links must be reserved for a designated parental area/gate, third-party analytics/ads are heavily restricted, and contextual ads are only permitted in limited policy-compliant cases. This must be re-verified immediately before release because App Review rules can change.

### 2.10 Notifications / encouragement

**USER-CONFIRMED REQUIRED iOS FEATURE:**

The final app includes encouragement/reminder notifications, controlled by user/parent settings. The design must include:

- permission request at an appropriate adult-controlled point, not on blind first launch;
- local notification scheduling/cancellation;
- cadence rules;
- localization;
- product-aware copy;
- no sensitive progress content on lock screen by default;
- setting persistence.

### 2.11 Android localization inventory

Current verified interface-language inventory from Android main app resources:

- English
- Amharic
- Arabic
- German
- Spanish
- French
- Hebrew
- Dutch
- Portuguese (Brazil)
- Portuguese (Portugal)
- Russian

Important distinctions:

- interface locale != learned language;
- Hebrew/Arabic UI are RTL;
- learned content direction is independent;
- English Only fixes **learned language** to English, excludes Hebrew as an interface choice, but retains the other supported interface locales;
- partial translations existing only in Android support libraries do not automatically become supported Minik interface locales.

### 2.12 Android reading/hosting-language policy

Android has reading-skill/hosting-language behavior that affects some clues/content choices. iOS has not yet modeled the full capability/parent-policy layer. This is a known parity area and must be addressed before Language release sign-off rather than accidentally hard-coding current Level A behavior forever.

---

# PART II — CANONICAL iOS PRODUCT TARGET

## 3. iOS architecture — required end state

### 3.1 Layering

The final architecture should be organized around these responsibilities:

1. **Product Configuration** — target/policy: Language, English Only, Math, Ping-Pong-only.
2. **Curriculum** — WHAT content is available at each language/math level.
3. **Activity Definitions** — HOW the child practices; production activity identity separate from generic engine type.
4. **Content Providers / Round Generators** — create semantic prompts, answers, distractors and representations.
5. **Pure Sessions / Game Engines** — deterministic state transitions and correctness.
6. **SwiftUI Activity Views** — presentation, gestures, animation, VoiceOver, lifecycle.
7. **Shared Feedback/Reward Layer** — points, streaks, success/failure, Minik, confetti, speech events.
8. **Progress Store** — local durable progress/statistics.
9. **Backend Services** — Firebase records/sync behind protocols.
10. **Parent & Settings** — adult controls, progress, languages, levels, notifications, purchases.
11. **Ads Boundary** — no SDK coupling in activity engines.
12. **Commerce Package** — reusable StoreKit package independent of Minik.
13. **Localization** — String Catalogs and locale policy.
14. **Assets/Artwork** — vocabulary images, math object library, mascot states, app icons.
15. **App Shell** — Home, activity menu, records, parent area, navigation.

### 3.2 Production activity identity must be explicit

A production activity is not the same thing as a reusable engine.

Example:

- `MultipleChoiceSession` may power Picture→Word, Word→Picture, First Letter, Math Visual→Answer, and Math Answer→Representation.
- Those remain distinct product activities because their semantics, prompts, menu placement, speech, progress metrics, and curriculum contracts differ.

### 3.3 Event-driven shared services

Every activity should emit typed events such as:

- activity started;
- challenge presented;
- answer attempted;
- correct/incorrect;
- round completed;
- activity completed/continued;
- score changed;
- streak changed;
- reward earned.

Shared services consume these events for progress, points, records, ads scheduling and feedback. Activities must not directly know Firebase/StoreKit/ad SDK APIs.

---

## 4. Language product — release target

### 4.1 Language production menu contract

Exactly the 13 production activities listed in §2.2 should be exposed. Internal helper engines remain hidden.

### 4.2 Deep parity requirement

A route/factory test alone does not equal release parity. Every activity must eventually pass a deep audit covering:

- Android behavior and known fixes;
- target learned-language policy;
- hosting/UI language policy;
- speech timing and replay buttons;
- progression and retry behavior;
- score/points/progress events;
- success/failure animation;
- iPhone/iPad layout;
- Dynamic Type;
- VoiceOver;
- RTL/LTR independence;
- lifecycle cancellation;
- final artwork/assets;
- localization;
- macOS/Xcode tests.

---

# PART III — MINIK MATH CANONICAL PRODUCT DESIGN

## 5. Math has 13 production activities too

**USER-CONFIRMED:** Math should carry the richness of the Language product rather than collapse into seven generic engines. The two Language activities that exist only because of “first letter” semantics are replaced by two simple Math construction activities.

### 5.1 Canonical Math activity set

| # | Math production activity | Language counterpart | Core Math behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Learn Math** | Learn Letters | Instructional, not a test. Show a concept and its answer/relationship. Example M1: 3 strawberries + `3`; later: `5 × 8` + `40`. |
| 2 | **Math Pairs** | Letter Pairs | Match two equivalent/related mathematical representations. M1: numeral ↔ quantity; later: expression ↔ equivalent value/expression. |
| 3 | **Build Number** | First Letter picture→letter replacement | Simple construction of the numeral/answer from a quantity or other approved prompt. Must remain distinct from the full Build Math activity. |
| 4 | **Build Quantity** | First Letter letter→picture replacement | Simple construction of the requested quantity/representation from a numeral/approved prompt. Distinct from Build Number and Build Math. |
| 5 | **Visual → Answer** | Picture→Word | Show a visual/math prompt, then four textual/numeric answers. Correct answer appears exactly once; distractors are plausible. |
| 6 | **Answer → Representation** | Word→Picture | Show a target number/value, then four visual/math representations; exactly one is semantically correct. |
| 7 | **Build Math** | Build Word | Full ordered answer/expression construction using tokens/input appropriate to the level. This is not automatically identical to Build Number. |
| 8 | **Math Mixed** | Mixed | Cycles several approved activity modes appropriate to the current Math level. |
| 9 | **Math Cards / Facts Table** | Word Cards | Learning/review sequence such as addition table or multiplication table; active cell/fact changes over time/manual advance. |
| 10 | **Math Soccer** | Soccer | Fixed answer-ball pool for a round; question changes until balls are consumed. Educational correctness is separate from shot outcome. |
| 11 | **Math Tower** | Tower | Build the target amount/value by dragging blocks; content adapts by level. |
| 12 | **Math Memory** | Picture Memory | Match two semantically equal mathematical representations. |
| 13 | **Ping Pong** | Ping Pong / Table Tennis | Just for fun; intentionally non-educational and outside Math curriculum/providers. |

This 13-item list supersedes the mistaken idea that `MathActivityKind` having seven generic cases means the Math product has seven activities.

## 6. Math visual representation philosophy

### 6.1 Beautiful object library, not dots as the final product

**USER-CONFIRMED:** final Math quantity prompts should use polished child-friendly art such as:

- strawberries;
- apples;
- bananas;
- chocolates;
- balls;
- other colorful/whimsical objects.

A single object asset is repeated/layout-composed dynamically; do not create a separate image asset for every quantity.

Dots may be used only as temporary development placeholders, never as the final visual identity unless the user explicitly chooses them for a specific teaching representation.

### 6.2 Scaling quantities

The representation system must avoid absurd layouts such as 108 individual objects.

Required strategy:

- small values: individual objects;
- larger values: structured grouping appropriate to the curriculum (for example groups/tens/ones/arrays/number-line/bundles);
- higher levels: operations and symbolic representations replace raw counting where pedagogically appropriate.

Exact thresholds are curriculum decisions and will be documented per level rather than hard-coded globally without approval.

### 6.3 Distractor quality

**USER-CONFIRMED:** four-choice exercises must not use obviously random answers.

Rules:

- correct answer appears **exactly once**;
- all options are distinct unless the specific mechanic explicitly permits duplicate physical answers (Soccer may);
- distractors should be plausible and level-aware;
- examples: adjacent count error, operand confusion, nearby value, wrong tens/ones, common arithmetic mistake, inverse-operation result, off-by-one, result from a visually similar prompt;
- generator must guarantee enough valid distractors and deterministic testing.

## 7. Detailed Math activity contracts

### 7.1 Learn Math

Instructional only. It teaches the relation instead of asking for an answer.

Examples:

- M1: three strawberries displayed with `3`.
- multiplication level: `5 × 8` displayed with `40`.
- fraction level: representation + fraction/decimal equivalence as approved.

Needs optional speech/instruction replay where appropriate, pacing/manual advance, and table/review modes where the curriculum calls for them.

### 7.2 Math Pairs

Pairs are semantic, not visual duplication.

Examples:

- `5` ↔ five strawberries;
- `2 + 3` ↔ `5`;
- `3 × 4` ↔ `12`;
- fraction/decimal equivalents at later levels.

### 7.3 Build Number

Simple Math replacement for one first-letter activity. The purpose is direct construction of the target numeral/answer, not word spelling.

At M1 the prompt is a quantity in `0...10`; several draggable numeral tokens are offered and the correct numeral occurs exactly once. No iOS keyboard is used. Later multi-digit answers are constructed digit by digit with distinct physical token IDs, including repeated digits, and future signed/decimal answers may add `-` and `.` tokens. It remains deliberately simpler than full Build Math.

### 7.4 Build Quantity

At M1, show a numeral in `0...10` and let the child drag/add exactly that many child-friendly objects into a target. Explicit submit validates semantic count, and remove/undo makes overshoot recoverable. Zero means adding nothing and submitting. Later representations evolve to grouping, place value, equal groups, fractions, or lines rather than absurd individual-object counts.

### 7.5 Visual → Answer

Canonical early-level example:

- prompt: five strawberries;
- answer choices: `2`, `4`, `5`, `15` (example only; distractor generator owns final choices);
- `5` must appear exactly once.

Higher-level example:

- prompt: `30 ÷ 6`;
- choices include `5` and plausible wrong answers.

### 7.6 Answer → Representation

Canonical early-level example:

- target: `5`;
- four visual choices: quantities such as 3, 5, 8, 15 using the object-layout system.

Higher-level example for target `5`:

- `2 + 4`
- `8 - 3` ← correct
- `9 - 3`
- `3 + 3`

The actual expressions depend on level content.

### 7.7 Build Math

Full construction counterpart of Build Word. Depending on level it can construct:

- a numeral;
- an equation;
- a missing value;
- an ordered mathematical expression;
- another approved structured answer.

**USER-CONFIRMED:** M1 Build Math is **Build the Count**. For a nonzero target quantity `N`, the child constructs the ordered chain `1 → 2 → ... → N` from number tokens, with extra candidate tokens and distinct physical IDs. This reinforces counting order and cardinality and is intentionally different from selecting numeral `N` in Build Number or constructing `N` objects in Build Quantity.

### 7.8 Math Mixed

A level-specific cycle over centrally approved graded educational modes. It never injects Learn, instructional Cards, or Ping Pong, delegates the real child-mode result to progress/adaptation, and avoids immediate pathological repetition. Exact cadence remains tunable policy data.

### 7.9 Math Cards / Facts Table

A learning/review activity rather than a graded one-question game. It supports useful manual, shuffle, and timed/looping review where appropriate and does not directly affect automatic level while instructional.

Examples:

- addition table;
- multiplication table;
- one fact/cell highlighted at a time;
- progresses manually or on a controlled timed mode;
- loops/reviews according to curriculum.

### 7.10 Math Soccer

**USER-CONFIRMED:**

- A round has a fixed pool of soccer balls carrying answer values.
- Questions change; balls do not get regenerated after each question.
- Correct ball is determined semantically for the current question.
- It is allowed to have two physical balls with the same displayed number when they correspond to separate questions/uses.
- Continue until the answer-ball pool is consumed according to the round design.
- Example M1: five strawberries → kick ball `5`.
- Higher level: `30 ÷ 6` → kick ball `5`.
- Score matrix remains the confirmed Soccer matrix:
  - correct + goal: child +1
  - correct + miss/save: nobody
  - wrong + goal: nobody
  - wrong + miss/save: keeper +1

### 7.11 Math Tower

**USER-CONFIRMED:** this is never number sorting and has two caller-selected modes.

- **Count Tower** for small readable answers: show the numeral/expression target, provide more blocks than the answer requires, let the child add/remove blocks, and validate only through an explicit large turquoise/silver checkmark buzzer. There is no countdown or inactivity completion. M1 shows the numeral `0...10`, not object pictures; zero blocks plus submit is valid. Wrong submit leaves the construction editable.
- **Answer Token Tower** for larger answers: build the ordered answer using digit/sign/decimal/fraction tokens as approved. For `10^4 → 10000`, build `1 → 0 → 0 → 0 → 0`. Repeated visible digits have distinct physical IDs and extra candidate tokens are always present.

The provider/caller chooses the mode from the approved readable representation; there is no hard global level threshold. Existing Language Tower ordered-letter behavior and speaker/replay behavior must be preserved. Math Tower uses interface/hosting-language prompt speech.

### 7.12 Math Memory

Match two equivalent values/representations. Examples vary by level: quantity↔numeral, expression↔value, equivalent expressions, fractions/decimals, etc. It must obey the current level's WHAT.

### 7.13 Ping Pong / Table Tennis

**USER-CONFIRMED 2026-08-31:** Language keeps Tic-Tac-Toe as its just-for-fun game. Minik Math uses Ping Pong. Ping Pong is not a `MathActivityKind`, `MathContentProvider`, challenge, skill, or learned-language activity.

#### 7.13.1 Four difficulties and controls

- **Starter** is a deliberately simplified drag-to-ball introduction. Minik automatically feeds slow balls; the child moves the approved middle paddle inside the lower strike region and receives a strongly assisted legal return when paddle and ball overlap.
- **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard** use the full timing/placement game. Before every new match the child chooses **Tap** or **Swipe**. Difficulty and the most recent full-game control mode persist independently.
- Switching to Starter hides the Tap/Swipe selector; switching away restores the persisted choice. Settings apply to the next match, not halfway through a rally.
- Easy has generous spatial/timing assistance. Medium is a meaningful challenge. Hard is faster and tighter but always retains non-zero Minik error and must remain beatable.

#### 7.13.2 Table and legal strike geometry

The game is top-down portrait table tennis: child at the bottom, Minik at the top, net at center. Ordinary child contact is legal only from the bottom baseline to approximately halfway between the bottom baseline and the net. A dragged paddle outside that region fades/becomes logically inactive and reactivates on re-entry. There are no Pong side-wall bounces.

#### 7.13.3 Tap

Tap means the child taps where the paddle should swing; the paddle is not persistently dragged. A return succeeds only after a legal bounce and when both timing and spatial distance are within the current difficulty tolerance. Left-half contact uses the current difficulty's backhand artwork; center/right uses forehand. Tap/contact offset modestly changes outgoing horizontal direction. Marginal timing/position lowers shot quality and can produce a net or out; there is no power meter.

#### 7.13.4 Swipe and Starter drag

Swipe is a physically controlled logical paddle that follows a held finger inside the legal strike zone. Crossing to the left selects backhand artwork; center/right selects forehand. The child may keep the finger down between returns. Collision uses legal rally state, paddle position, velocity, direction, and timing. Velocity affects power and direction, with centralized safe clamps preventing tunneling, degenerate angles, or one noisy sample creating an absurd shot. Starter uses the same zone but the dedicated middle-paddle asset and assisted overlap contact rather than full Swipe power/aim.

#### 7.13.5 Shared contact and flight model

Tap and Swipe produce one `PingPongContact` containing point, timing quality, spatial quality, paddle velocity, intended horizontal direction, and mode. One shared solver creates outgoing velocity/arc. Ball flight is deterministic manual logic: normalized x/y, simple height/gravity, table bounce, net crossing/height, and out detection. A normal shot must clear the net and first-bounce on the opponent side. Net, first-bounce out, second bounce/no return, or leaving the table resolves the rally; no invisible wall recovery or service lets are implemented. Real spin, 3D, and tournament-level foul complexity are intentionally out of scope.

#### 7.13.6 Serving

- Starter always receives an automatic Minik feed and has no manual legal serve ritual.
- Tap serve accepts a tap anywhere on the table. A tap on the child half primarily supplies the own-side first bounce; a tap on the Minik half primarily supplies the receiver-side second bounce. The solver derives the other bounce and applies difficulty-based assistance.
- Swipe serve presents a ready ball on the child side and uses swipe speed, direction, and contact placement. It must still bounce on the server side, clear the net, and bounce on the receiver side; an illegal child serve awards Minik the point.
- Minik serves automatically after a short visible ready/strike transition, with difficulty-dependent speed, placement, side preference, and non-zero error.

#### 7.13.7 Minik rally AI

Minik return success is not a blind coin flip. It combines predicted landing/contact position, incoming speed/angle/depth, reaction delay, reach, prediction, tracking/aim error, and a small difficulty-dependent random error. Slow central shots are easier; fast/deep/corner shots are harder. Reached shots use the corresponding ready/strike pose pair. Hard is strong but never perfect.

#### 7.13.8 Match targets, scoring, and service rotation

- Starter/Easy targets: `3 / 5 / 7 / 10`, default `7`; first to target wins with no two-point requirement.
- Medium/Hard targets: `3 / 5 / 7 / 11`, default `7`; target plus a two-point lead is required, with no score cap.
- Starter: Minik feeds every rally. Easy: child serves every rally.
- Medium/Hard: child starts; service rotates in groups of two completed rallies. Once both reach `target - 1`, service alternates every rally.
- Play Again resets score/service state while preserving difficulty, applicable control mode, and the per-difficulty target.

#### 7.13.9 Presentation, accessibility, and lifecycle

The dedicated arena is used instead of the generic practice frame. SpriteKit is embedded in SwiftUI, while scoring, flight, contact, AI, persistence validation, and service rules remain pure/testable. The HUD shows scores, current settings, target, and useful server state without covering the table. Score/server/result announcements and left/right accessibility actions provide a practical alternative for the timing/spatial game. Reduce Motion keeps required ball motion but reduces pose flourishes. Backgrounding, disappearance, and exit pause/cancel simulation and pending work so a point cannot duplicate after resume.

#### 7.13.10 Approved production artwork

Production asset names are:

- `ping_pong_arena`, `ping_pong_table`, `ping_pong_ball`;
- `ping_pong_player_starter_paddle`;
- `ping_pong_player_easy_backhand`, `ping_pong_player_easy_forehand`;
- `ping_pong_player_medium_backhand`, `ping_pong_player_medium_forehand`;
- `ping_pong_player_hard_backhand`, `ping_pong_player_hard_forehand`;
- `minik_ping_pong_left_ready`, `minik_ping_pong_left_strike`;
- `minik_ping_pong_right_ready`, `minik_ping_pong_right_strike`.

The staging typo `strater` and generated `ChatGPT Image ...` filenames must never leak into production API/user-facing names. The selected ball is the visually inspected first square white-ball candidate (`ChatGPT Image Aug 31, 2026, 01_23_08 AM (2).png` in staging). Artwork is presentation only; hit/collision decisions remain data-driven.

## 8. Math curriculum M1–M10 — confirmed progression

The following WHAT progression is user-confirmed. All twelve educational activity identities remain present at every level and evolve their HOW; Ping Pong remains the thirteenth non-curriculum identity. Exact generated pools and cadence remain tunable engineering policy without reopening these curriculum decisions.

The durable 130-cell architecture/status inventory is maintained in [`math-production-matrix.md`](math-production-matrix.md). It separates user-confirmed product authority from implementation status and records the remaining higher-level content-authoring/tuning work without treating identity or route presence as completion.

### M1 — Number represents quantity

`0...10`: counting, cardinality, numeral↔quantity, and basic more/less where useful.

Expected visual emphasis: beautiful individual-object quantities.

### M2 — Composition/decomposition and early operations

Values/results within `0...10`: part/whole, early addition/subtraction, and complements to ten.

### M3 — Operations and relationships between expressions

Addition/subtraction relationships within `0...20`: missing values/addends, equivalent expressions, and relationships among expressions.

### M4 — Place value / numbers to 100 / richer addition-subtraction

Numbers to 100: place value, tens/ones, comparison/magnitude, and richer addition/subtraction within 100.

### M5 — Meaning of multiplication and division

Equal groups, arrays, sharing/grouping, and simple multiplication/division facts, especially the 1–5 and 10 families.

### M6 — Fluency, factors/multiples, initial fraction relationships

Multiplication/division fluency through `10×10` and corresponding division, factors, multiples, and initial half/quarter/simple-fraction relationships.

### M7 — Fractions and decimals as numbers

Simple fractions and tenths/hundredths as numbers: magnitude, comparison/order, number line, and basic equivalence.

### M8 — Fraction / decimal / percent / ratio relationships

Translation among fraction/decimal/percent/ratio forms, simple ratios, and semantic equivalence such as `1/2 = 0.5 = 50%`.

### M9 — Pre-algebra

Negative numbers, basic order of operations, simple powers, ratios, and one-step equations.

### M10 — Algebraic relationships

One/two-step equations, simple linear relationships, proportional reasoning, and introductory probability/geometry concepts.

**Rule:** none of these levels becomes implementation-ready merely because an enum/descriptor exists. Automatic routing is clamped to the highest level whose twelve educational activities are functionally runnable. All thirteen identities remain in the architecture/menu contract; unfinished content is never substituted with an unrelated engine.

---

# PART IV — ENGLISH ONLY CONTRACT

## 9. Minik Plus English / English Only

The English Only target uses the shared Language architecture.

Required behavior:

- learned language is always English;
- learned-language selector hidden/unavailable;
- stored unsupported/Hebrew learned-language values resolve to English;
- Hebrew is excluded from interface-language choices;
- the other verified Android interface locales remain eligible;
- all 13 Language production activities remain available unless a separately documented product policy says otherwise;
- no forked copies of activity engines;
- same parent/progress/rewards/ads/commerce infrastructure;
- separate App Store bundle/listing only if that remains the chosen distribution model.

Final release gate must test English Only independently from MinikPlus because policy bugs can compile successfully while exposing the wrong language choices.

---

# PART V — SHARED SYSTEMS REQUIRED FOR A COMPLETE APP

## 10. App shell and navigation

Final SwiftUI shell must include:

- branded home/menu;
- sectioned activity cards;
- Home affordance;
- points/streak/records affordance;
- Parent Area entry;
- settings/language/level entry where relevant;
- navigation/presentation that works on small iPhone, large iPhone and iPad;
- safe-area correctness;
- portrait/landscape behavior according to final product policy;
- no activity owning global navigation state.

## 11. Rewards, points, streaks, achievements and records

Create a shared typed reward system:

- points rules;
- current streak;
- best streak;
- high score / record categories;
- activity result summaries;
- level-up/achievement events if retained;
- persistence;
- backend upload/download for global records where required;
- no duplicated per-view scoring logic.

## 12. Progress model

Required data model should support:

- product/profile identity;
- current Language content level / reading skill where applicable;
- Math level;
- per-activity attempts/correct/incorrect;
- per-skill mastery/progress;
- practice time/session history where approved;
- most recent activity date;
- points/streak records;
- parent-readable aggregates;
- migration/versioning of local storage.

Use protocols so storage can start local and sync selected data via Firebase without coupling activities to Firebase.

### 12.1 Attempt identity and replay safety

Activity events carry unique event IDs and typed graded-attempt data: stable item/challenge identity where available, attempt index/first-attempt state, correct/incorrect/skip result, response duration, activity family, optional Math level, and optional skill. Correctness never depends on UI text. Applying the same event ID twice must be idempotent so future backend retry/sync cannot double-count; a genuine retry has a new event ID and attempt index.

### 12.2 Automatic Math level

Math defaults to **Automatic**. The child-facing hub shows the persisted active level but is not a free level picker. Future Parent Area exposes Automatic/Manual: Automatic prevents direct parent level selection; Manual allows Level 1–10 and never changes it automatically. Returning from Manual to Automatic uses the selected manual level as the new starting point.

Automatic tuning is centralized and testable:

- first run begins at Level 1 absent valid persisted state;
- calibration uses about three graded first attempts: `3/3` may test `+2`, `2/3` may test `+1`, and `0–1/3` settles/steps down;
- normal promotion: eight consecutive first-attempt correct or at least 18 of the last 20;
- normal demotion: seven consecutive first-attempt unsuccessful or at most 8 of the last 20;
- time is a secondary activity-family baseline; one response over roughly two minutes is a signal, never sole demotion authority;
- an increase has about six graded probation attempts and reverts near four failures; ordinary changes then have about ten attempts of cooldown, with severe failure allowed to override;
- eligible graded families are Pairs, Build Number, Build Quantity, Visual→Answer, Answer→Representation, Build Math, graded Mixed child modes, Soccer, Tower, and Memory;
- Learn, instructional Cards, and Ping Pong do not directly affect level;
- routing is clamped to the highest implementation-ready level (currently M10); all ten canonical levels are eligible because each full twelve-activity production slice is coherent.

## 13. Parent Area

Final Parent Area should expose appropriate adult controls and information in one coherent place:

- child/profile identity if the product supports multiple profiles;
- learned language (Language only);
- interface language;
- Language reading/skill/level controls;
- Math level controls;
- progress/statistics;
- points/streak/records;
- encouragement notifications setting;
- remove ads purchase/restore/status;
- privacy/support/legal links;
- version/build info if useful;
- parental gate for adult actions when required by App Store policy.

## 14. Firebase / backend architecture

Create an app-owned service boundary, for example:

- `RecordsRepository`
- `ProgressSyncRepository` if progress sync is approved
- `BackendIdentityProvider`

Firebase implementation belongs behind those protocols.

Required release work:

- iOS Firebase configuration per App Store target/environment;
- App Check configuration;
- Firestore/database contract compatibility where Android records must interoperate;
- offline cache/retry;
- duplicate/conflict handling;
- test/dev backend isolation;
- privacy review.

Do not embed Firebase types inside activity sessions.

## 15. Ads architecture

Create `AdService`/provider boundary with events such as “eligible interstitial opportunity”.

Requirements:

- no targeted advertising to children;
- App Store/Kids policy verified before choosing SDK/provider;
- interstitial frequency/counters documented and tested;
- clear ad labeling/close behavior;
- inappropriate-ad reporting if required by Apple/provider policy;
- disabled when remove-ads entitlement is active;
- no ads inside extensions/notifications;
- development/mock provider for tests.

## 16. Reusable Apple Store / StoreKit library

**USER-CONFIRMED:** App Store purchasing must be implemented in a **separate reusable library** that can be used in other applications.

### 16.1 Recommended package boundary

Create a standalone Swift Package, preferably in its own reusable repository or an easily extractable directory such as:

`Packages/AppStoreCommerceKit/`

The package must contain **no Minik-specific product IDs, strings, views, Firebase code, ad SDK code, or bundle assumptions**.

### 16.2 Generic package responsibilities

Suggested public concepts:

- `CommerceProductID`
- `CommerceProduct`
- `EntitlementID`
- `EntitlementState`
- `PurchaseOutcome`
- `CommerceStore` protocol
- `StoreKitCommerceStore` implementation
- product loading;
- purchase flow;
- verified transaction handling;
- current entitlement refresh;
- transaction updates listener;
- explicit restore/sync operation;
- cancellation/pending/error states;
- test/mock store;
- optional generic subscription support even if Minik initially uses a non-consumable remove-ads product.

### 16.3 Current Apple API direction (checked 2026-08-30)

Use StoreKit 2. Current Apple documentation exposes verified `Transaction` values, `Transaction.currentEntitlements`, transaction update sequences, and `AppStore.sync()` for an explicit user-initiated restore/sync path. `AppStore.sync()` should be invoked only from explicit user action because it can prompt for App Store authentication.

For a one-time permanent “Remove Ads” purchase, a **non-consumable** In-App Purchase is the natural StoreKit product type unless the product owner explicitly chooses a subscription model.

These Apple details must be rechecked against official documentation at implementation/release time.

### 16.4 Minik adapter

Minik owns a thin adapter/configuration layer:

- product ID(s);
- mapping `removeAds` entitlement;
- localized purchase copy;
- Parent Area purchase UI;
- remove-ads reminder;
- ad service response to entitlement changes;
- App Store Connect setup.

The generic package must be usable by another app by supplying different IDs/configuration.

## 17. Remove Ads reminder

Required state:

- whether ads are already removed;
- reminder shown count/date/cadence;
- do not nag after entitlement active;
- presentation only in an adult-appropriate context if required;
- purchase and restore routes;
- persistence survives app relaunch.

## 18. Localization

Use Apple String Catalogs (`.xcstrings`) and keep these separate:

- interface strings;
- learned vocabulary/content;
- speech locale metadata.

Current foundation (2026-09-01):

- Apple String Catalogs exist for the full product set and the English Only target;
- the full catalog covers English, Amharic, Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Dutch, Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, and Russian;
- the English Only catalog excludes Hebrew while retaining the other ten interface locales;
- deterministic validation and likely-hardcoded-literal audit scripts exist;
- the current audit reports **0 unreviewed likely user-visible hardcoded Swift literals** and validates referenced keys, locale coverage, shared-key parity, and English Only's Hebrew exclusion;
- all newly cataloged non-Android/iOS/Math copy has entries for each target locale; entries without an exact verified translation remain marked `needs_review`, so native-language linguistic QA remains a release gate.

Requirements:

- all hardcoded child/parent UI copy migrated to localization resources;
- verified Android interface locales implemented;
- English Only Hebrew-interface exclusion implemented centrally;
- complete-message localization, not concatenated fragments;
- RTL/LTR independent learning-content direction;
- math expressions remain mathematically ordered in RTL UI;
- screenshots/QA in long translations.

## 19. Artwork and assets

### 19.1 Language artwork

Current migration work already covers hundreds of vocabulary images. It remains a separate controlled stream until format/quality decisions are closed.

Known artwork corrections include previously identified wrong/ambiguous assets (for example dehumidifier/helix/cyan-turquoise issues from earlier audits).

### 19.2 Math artwork

Create a polished reusable object library with enough variety that quantity questions feel magical rather than repetitive.

Categories should include, after art direction approval:

- fruit;
- sweets/food;
- toys;
- balls/sports;
- animals/child-safe objects;
- school/nature objects;
- themed grouping/ten/array assets if needed.

Each object needs:

- transparent/background-safe rendering as appropriate;
- consistent visual scale;
- clear silhouette at small sizes;
- no embedded number that leaks the answer;
- licensing/ownership traceability;
- asset catalog naming/manifest.

The permanent generation/approval handoff is [`math-object-art-requirements.md`](math-object-art-requirements.md). It requires isolated single countable objects, neutral empty-container zero states, a coherent 6–8-theme baseline, small-size legibility, and source masters. Current procedural dots/shapes are development-only. Final source format remains subject to the real Xcode asset-format benchmark; do not generate or commit speculative final art merely to bypass that gate.

### 19.3 Minik mascot states

Need final production mascot assets/animations for:

- neutral/home;
- success;
- encouragement/failure;
- celebration/confetti;
- Soccer;
- Tower;
- Tic-Tac-Toe;
- Ping Pong (Math and standalone product);
- cards/learning where relevant;
- parent/home branding.

### 19.4 Product-aware frames and Ping Pong assets

**USER-CONFIRMED 2026-08-31:** `math_frame_background` is the Minik Math decorative frame for the same broad class of child-facing practice surfaces that use the Language decorative background. Selection is centralized/product-aware; Language remains unchanged. The artwork uses aspect-fill/crop without distortion and foreground surfaces retain readability. Ping Pong always uses `ping_pong_arena` instead.

Ping Pong and Math-frame assets are imported from `C:\Projects\Minik\artwork-staging\ping-pong` into separate explicit catalogs. `Resources/PingPongAssets.xcassets` belongs to Minik Math and Minik Ping Pong; `Resources/MathVisuals.xcassets` belongs only to Minik Math. Neither catalog is mixed with the Phase 41 vocabulary migration or accidentally added to Language targets.

## 20. Accessibility and responsive design

Mathematical content is never truncated or ellipsized: a missing digit/operator can change the answer. The shared presentation-fit order is normal layout, adaptive dimensions, font reduction only to the centralized readable minimum (currently 18 pt), wider/taller layout, then at most two lines as a last visual fallback. If content still does not fit, regenerate synchronously from the same level/skill/mechanic for at most 12 candidates, use an approved compact representation when available, or show a localized retry state. Soccer may reduce its pool to no fewer than four meaningful choices. Infinite regeneration and unreadably small tokens are forbidden.

Every final screen/activity must be tested for:

- smallest supported iPhone;
- large iPhone;
- iPad compact/full layouts;
- portrait/landscape as supported;
- Dynamic Type;
- VoiceOver labels/hints/actions;
- Reduce Motion;
- contrast/touch target sizes;
- safe areas/home indicator;
- independent RTL/LTR UI and content direction;
- cancellation of timers/speech/tasks on exit/background.

## 22. Current project configuration

Current `project.yml` snapshot:

- minimum iOS deployment target: 17.0;
- Swift language version: 5.9;
- iPhone + iPad targeted;
- `MinikPlus`, `MinikPlusEnglish`, `MinikMath`, `MinikPingPong` targets;
- `Resources/GameAudio` included in the two Language targets;
- Language vocabulary/image resources included in the Language targets;
- unit-test target currently depends on `MinikPlus`.

The canonical production Apple identifiers are `com.appsbybros.minik.plus`,
`com.appsbybros.minik.plus.english`, `com.appsbybros.minik.math`, and
`com.appsbybros.minik.pingpong`; the test bundle uses
`com.appsbybros.minik.tests`. Apple/Firebase/AdMob/App Store registration and
matching configuration remain external release work.

## 23. Implemented/reviewed iOS capabilities

### Shared/foundation already present

- Swift/SwiftUI shared project architecture.
- Product configuration with Language / English Only / Math / Ping-Pong-only targets.
- Content contracts and semantic IDs.
- Generic sessions/views for multiple choice, build, pairs, memory, learn, cards, Soccer, Tower.
- learned-language direction/speech metadata infrastructure.
- current vocabulary normalization/catalog infrastructure.

### Language production

Static production parity gate now exposes exactly 13 Android-visible activities.

Deep independently reviewed recent phases:

- Picture Memory — implemented and corrected.
- Mixed — implemented.
- Soccer — implemented with Android-faithful educational/shot separation.
- Tower / Alphabet Blocks — implemented.
- Tic-Tac-Toe — implemented on sprint branch; extensive deterministic AI tests; static correction pass completed.

Other Language activities have production routes/providers, but must still pass final deep release audit against Android and global systems before the entire Language product is called release-complete.

### Tic-Tac-Toe correction status

The post-sprint correction fixed:

- invalid Swift factory trailing-closure binding syntax;
- AI unit random interval so it is `[0,1)`;
- regression tests for max RNG and 100% Medium probabilities;
- Games section copy.

Static review inspected the corrected source and structural searches found no remaining invalid factory-call pattern. No Swift parser/compiler was available in the Windows environment, so parsing/type-checking did not run; Xcode/XCTest/Simulator validation remains required.

### Math current functional slice

Core milestone: `MATH_EDUCATIONAL_CORE_FUNCTIONAL_WINDOWS_STATIC_COMPLETE` (2026-09-02). This is a Windows-static educational-core marker only; it explicitly does not claim Swift compilation, XCTest, Simulator/device validation, linguistic completion, commercial-system completion, or release readiness. Evidence and remaining gates are in `docs/math-educational-core-audit.md`.

The architecture retains all ten level identities and all thirteen product identities at every level. M1 through M10 now have coherent Windows-statically-validated implementations for all twelve educational activities at each level; Ping Pong remains the thirteenth non-curriculum activity. Automatic level selection is clamped to the highest implemented level, currently M10.

M1–M10 are **not release-complete**: each has a dedicated coherent production slice and the approved object/zero/grouping pack plus native fraction bars, number lines, percent bars, ratio groupings, signed-number placement, probability diagrams, and geometry diagrams are integrated, but Xcode asset compilation, device-scale visual QA, XCTest, Simulator/device interaction, speech, accessibility, and layout validation remain required.

### Ping Pong and Math visual-identity sprint

Implemented in the 2026-08-31 working tree/checkpoint:

- pure match scoring, target validation, two-point rule, and service rotation;
- four centralized tunings and persisted difficulty/mode/per-difficulty target;
- Starter drag/reach, full Tap, full Swipe, table-only Tap serving, difficulty-assisted but fallible Swipe serving, Minik serve, shared shot solver, deterministic flight/rally resolution, and incoming-shot-aware Minik AI with distinct miss/sound/imperfect-contact outcomes;
- SpriteKit scene embedded in SwiftUI with approved paddle/ball/arena/Minik pose assets, one arena-image-calibrated responsive table-coordinate mapping, lifecycle pause/cancel, Reduce Motion handling, and accessibility announcements/actions;
- Minik Math just-for-fun Ping Pong route outside `MathActivityKind`/curriculum;
- standalone `MinikPingPong` target/root with no curriculum, learned-language state, Parent Area, or activity hub;
- narrow host completed-match/action seam for future shared Ads/commerce/code systems, with no fake implementation;
- centralized Math practice-background selection using `math_frame_background`, leaving Language unchanged;
- deterministic unit-test source for match, controls, flight, serving, AI, persistence, product routing, and configuration.

Windows validation is limited to repository/static checks because Swift/Xcode/XCTest/Simulator are unavailable. macOS build, XCTest, SpriteKit/SwiftUI runtime behavior, asset compilation, device layout, accessibility, and final difficulty tuning remain mandatory.

## 24. Current artwork/migration state

The Phase 41 vocabulary catalog now has source-complete iOS coverage for all 543 image-capable items: 397 validated Android migrations, 8 deterministic local masters, 33 pinned licensed/public-domain acquisitions, and 93 individually generated and visually reviewed masters. The dehumidifier and helix Android-source errors have reviewed replacements without changing vocabulary identity or behavior. Xcode asset-catalog compilation, Simulator/device scale, accessibility, and final human art-direction QA remain open.

## 25. Current full-product completion estimate

This is an engineering estimate, not a promise and not simply a lines-of-code percentage.

As of 2026-09-13, after M1–M10, the Language source-parity gate, Parent/progress/records work, release-source integrations, and Phase 41 vocabulary-source closure:

- shared engines/foundation: approximately **85–90%**, depending on subsystem;
- Language mechanics/routes: approximately **90–95% source-functional**, lower when runtime/device and release-service validation are included;
- Math educational product: approximately **80–85% source-functional** across the approved M1–M10 × 12 educational matrix, lower when macOS/device validation and final tuning are included;
- Parent/progress/records: approximately **75–85%**, with local surfaces, rewards, and the Android-compatible Firebase boundary present but live backend/account/privacy validation still open;
- ads/commerce/notifications: source boundaries and Parent controls are implemented fail-closed; production account values, provider/policy approval, StoreKit/App Store setup, and device validation remain open;
- localization: source/catalog infrastructure and locale coverage are present; native-language linguistic QA remains incomplete;
- final artwork: all 543 vocabulary items and the approved Math object pack are source-ready; device-scale QA, final app icons, and remaining brand/mascot art decisions remain open;
- macOS/Xcode/TestFlight hardening: the latest supplied run built all four apps and executed 797 ProductConfigurationTests with one deterministic M3 test defect; that assertion was corrected afterward, but the repaired suite, new release-source integrations, and complete current asset catalog have not been rerun on macOS.

**Overall release-readiness engineering estimate: approximately 70–75%. This is not a delivery promise.**

This number should be updated only after meaningful phase completion, not after every small commit.

# PART VIII — COMPLETE DELIVERY ROADMAP / SPRINT PLAN

The roadmap is deliberately long. It is safer to have an explicit finish line than to pretend the remaining app is one feature.

## PHASE A — Ground truth, safety, and buildability

### Sprint A0 — Canonical master plan
**Status:** CURRENT / document created 2026-08-30.

Deliverables:

- this file accepted as canonical;
- copy into `ios/docs/MINIK_MASTER_PLAN.md`;
- future Codex sessions instructed to update living status only;
- wrong “7 Math activities” mental model formally retired.

### Sprint A1 — Repository convergence and branch hygiene

Deliverables:

- verify local/remote `codex-sprint-8h-20260830` includes `02cf3d7`;
- review sprint commits before integrating to `main`;
- selectively merge/cherry-pick only approved work;
- preserve Phase 41 dirty asset work;
- replace/remove temporary unattended `AGENTS.md` exception after it is no longer needed;
- status/index clean for the feature baseline.

### Sprint A2 — Early macOS/Xcode baseline gate

# PART IX — LIVING STATUS (CODEX MAY UPDATE THIS SECTION)

## 28. Current active phase

**CURRENT 80’s PONG PARITY / SHARED MATH ENTRY — 2026-09-28: SOURCE IMPLEMENTED, APPLE VALIDATION PENDING.** The owner authorized committing the preceding Modern work (local commit `b15717f`, `main`; no push), matching current Android 80’s Pong, retaining both games inside Math and adding a standalone 80’s entry without a feature-mode parameter. `Resources/RetroPong` shares the current Android payload through a native SwiftUI/WKWebView host; `MinikRetroPingPong` is the new standalone scheme. Math routes to current Modern Simple or the same Retro game. This supersedes the older four-target and “Math routing unchanged” descriptions for these Pong entry points only; it does not change the Math curriculum. Android now has a Math app, but it was not used to redefine iOS curriculum in this task. Retro has no ads/Firebase; Modern’s existing Debug test ads are unchanged, pending future common ads-library work. Sixteen game and seven bridge tests, 191 Retro and 152 Modern source/asset checks, existing release/ads/commerce/test-source audits and six-file Swift grammar parse pass. Seven new native XCTest cases, compilation, WebKit rendering/audio and actual iOS play remain unverified. Browser discovery was empty; no Pixel/ADB, backend, push or workflow dispatch occurred. `docs/retro-pong-ios-handoff.md` contains the exact inventory, behavior and Apple checklist; a new manual-only Retro workflow is ready for owner dispatch after pushing.



**MODERN PING PONG ANDROID PARITY — 2026-09-28: IMPLEMENTED IN SOURCE, APPLE RUNTIME GATE PENDING.** The owner authorized current Android Modern parity in `ios-main-merge`, a shared Full/Simple entry parameter, no 80s changes, and no Pixel use. New native `Sources/ModernPong` contains the Android-derived engine/tuning/tutorial/art/audio plus house players, profiles, friendly games, tournaments, RTDB transport and test ads/StoreKit UI. The standalone root uses Full; Simple closes through a host callback and has no online/tournament/profile surfaces. Existing Math/legacy routing is unchanged. Firebase Apple registration for `com.appsbybros.minik.pingpong` has now been created in `minikswish`; the checked-in matching plist uses only `minikPingPong/`. No production rules/data, TripleShot, Android, Git or device mutations occurred. Windows source/asset audits and 43 isolated RTDB emulator tests pass. Native compilation, the 25 authored XCTest cases, Simulator/physical iOS, cross-platform live play and StoreKit runtime remain pending. See `docs/modern-pong-ios-handoff.md` for the exact change manifest, commands and release gates. This explicitly supersedes older statements that standalone Pong has no Firebase or purchase UI; Language/Math contracts remain unchanged.

**ACTIVE RELEASE-SOURCE HARDENING - 2026-09-14:** The independently implementable source work requested after the Language/Math/Ping Pong verification pass now includes complete source coverage for all 543 Phase 41 vocabulary images; Firebase-backed Language records with curated aliases, Parent opt-out/deletion, recoverable pending scores, and a distinct secure `v2_<UUID>` per product/profile; anonymous-authenticated query/write/delete transport; private immutable `leaderboard_owners/{player_id}` bindings that allow one Auth UID to own multiple profiles without exposing or substituting that UID; strict public field/type/value Rules and exact indexes; a selected archive/clear legacy cutover with an exact read-only-Android implementation handoff; local Parent-controlled reminders; Remove Ads integration; fail-closed child-directed ads rejecting known Google sample/test identifiers; canonical Apple identifiers and isolated production Firebase plists; DEBUG-only App Check debug selection and Release App Attest; exact privacy/App Store/signing handoffs; and targeted accessibility source gates. Updated iOS never claims a legacy public UUID and can republish retained local bests under its secure ID. Deployment remains intentionally blocked until the administrator archive/clear cutover and updated Android client are ready. These are Windows-static source milestones only. Apple/AdMob/App Store registration, external values, policy/legal approval, Android rollout, Firebase deployment/verification, macOS/Xcode compilation/tests, device behavior, privacy publication, TestFlight and App Store validation remain open.

**ACTIVE GITHUB-HOSTED SIMULATOR GATE - 2026-09-13:** The preferred manual-only workflow is now a dedicated full validation gate. Every dispatch attempts all four unsigned Simulator builds in one macOS job, runs ProductConfigurationTests exactly once after all four compilations are clean, boots one available modern iPhone Simulator, and sequentially installs, launches, observes, screenshots, diagnoses, and terminates every built app. Build, packaging, test, Simulator, and launch failures are aggregated only after short-retention evidence uploads. This is workflow/static readiness only until an authorized manual GitHub Actions run supplies real macOS results.

**ACTIVE LANGUAGE ANDROID-PARITY RECONSTRUCTION — 2026-09-06:** Started on `codex-sprint-8h-20260830` at `084ca2a3405700fa65841beadd3685ddcaec5d6c`. The owner's latest Simulator images and complete-product gate supersede earlier tap-only Soccer and static visual-lock claims. All 16 Android screenshots, layouts, assets and source are binding Language/shared visual references. Owner annotations are the minimum scope; known source discrepancies cannot be deferred to runtime.

The first source unit restores Intro → menu → activity navigation, Intro Parent entry, the original opening clip and full wordmark, Android phone/tablet menu proportions, a compact Language Parent dialog, and selected-interface-language lookup/catalogs. Learn now restores all original letter forms, separated word/picture regions, height-aware controls and the owner-required triangular Play-style replay affordance. Pairs now has a fixed 2x4 board and original timing/audio. Four choice compositions, typed host-clue Build, full reaction artwork/speech completion, real Android word rewards, and Cards viewport/timer repairs are implemented in source. Picture Memory now has its dedicated fixed 3x4 Android composition, exact pastel scene, automatic guarded transitions and clean continuous rounds while Math Memory remains unchanged. Language Tower now has its dedicated Android-derived loose-block/beach scene, locked bottom-up stack, guarded continuous rounds, original speech/failure feedback and verified fixed +2 completion integration while Math Tower remains unchanged. Language Tic-Tac-Toe now has its dedicated fixed Android-derived panel, exact board-holding mascot, full white-cell gradient board, guarded continuous rounds and preserved just-for-fun AI contract. Parent Levels opens the Android-derived Language difficulty destination with immediate persisted Auto/manual word A-E, Soccer A-C and Tic-Tac-Toe A-E/Random/Adaptive choices; the selected word stage drives production vocabulary providers without coupling to learned/interface language or Math. Soccer, Parent Levels/Language Auto, and final Mixed/system behavior are reconciled at source level. Mixed retains its exact repeating 20/10/5 typed children, identity-guards stale child callbacks, rolls failed construction back atomically, and cannot feed Android Write Auto evidence. The 13-route Language source gate is recorded as `ANDROID_PARITY_IMPLEMENTED_SOURCE`; `RUNTIME_VISUAL_VERIFICATION_PENDING` remains separate in the [second-Simulator correction ledger](language-second-simulator-correction-ledger.md) and parity lock.

Required final statuses are ANDROID_PARITY_IMPLEMENTED_SOURCE and, separately, RUNTIME_VISUAL_VERIFICATION_PENDING. New Swift source, XCTest, rendering, gestures, animation and audio need a real Mac/iPhone/iPad review. Selective local checkpoints only; no push, CI, workflow execution or Phase 41 staging. Math Level = WHAT / Activity = HOW and English Only policy remain unchanged.

**PREVIOUS MAC GATE REPAIR - 2026-09-05:** At the matching expected local HEAD `180155bedc7d421e3c5ffc391e943a32bffec604`, the latest supplied Xcode 26.6 / Swift 6.3.3 facts are all four apps BUILD SUCCEEDED and 797 ProductConfigurationTests executed: 796 passed, one M3 Build assertion failed. Classification before repair: TEST_DEFECT. Gate #6 commit `27ccca2` asserted the dedicated M3 provider's typed prompt on a test that instantiates the older generic factory, whose prompt is always `.mathExpression`. The corrected test verifies that factory's missing-addend prompt and complete ordered solution; new deterministic production tests retain strict typed semantics across the six-challenge session and all 16 M3 relationships. Production and the canonical Math contract are unchanged. A Windows boundary guard rejects the original assertion and is included in the standard test audit. Evidence: [M3 Build XCTest root cause](m3-build-xctest-root-cause.md). The repaired tests still require a real Mac rerun; one local checkpoint only, no push or CI.

**HISTORICAL STATUS - 2026-09-05:** The active product branch is `codex-sprint-8h-20260830`; this investigation started at `180155bedc7d421e3c5ffc391e943a32bffec604`. All four apps now have supplied compile-success evidence, and the latest real XCTest run passed 796 of 797 tests. The remaining M3 Build failure is a deterministic wrong-factory test assertion; its repair and added typed production regressions need Mac confirmation. Gate #6's prior claim that this assertion was resolved was incorrect. The no-CI product sprint restored the shared Minik visual foundation, corrected the reported Soccer and Ping Pong Simulator findings, audited Language speech paths, restored Parent Area visual parity, and continued the Windows-static Language audits without triggering GitHub Actions. The separate default-branch workflow-safety commit `2f00c04` remains intentionally outside the product branch and must not be merged merely for continuity.

M1 through M10 each have coherent twelve-activity production slices. M10 teaches two-step equations, linear relationships, proportions, probability, and rectangle measurement using validated typed representations, normalized `Rational` answer semantics, native probability/geometry diagrams, exact matching/choices, probability construction, ordered token grammar, and Answer Token Tower. Generated content is fit-gated, graded events carry the actual level, and Automatic readiness includes all ten levels. Every level remains pre-release pending macOS/Xcode/Simulator validation, visual QA, and native-language linguistic QA.

The educational products now have one localized Parent Area integrated into the shared shell. Minik Plus exposes persisted English/Hebrew learned-language selection; English Only displays fixed English without offering Hebrew; Math exposes Automatic/Manual mode and Level 1...Level 10 selection only while Manual; all use the central persisted interface-locale controller and a persisted encouragement preference. Minik Ping Pong remains outside this shell. No unconfirmed parental gate or notification cadence was invented.

Progress / Statistics now reads the replay-safe local repository through a deterministic product-filtered read model. It reports actual total typed attempts, first-attempt correct/accuracy, accumulated response time, recent practice, deterministic per-activity rows, and Math level/mode. Existing Math routes persist by exact production activity identity; Language choice/build/pairs/memory/Mixed plus specialized Soccer and Tower routes now persist typed attempts without Math fields. Soccer and Tower use stable word-plus-token challenge identities, per-token retry indices, actual educational correctness, and response duration while preserving their game/animation behavior. Learn, Cards, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Ping Pong are excluded from mastery. The UI explicitly says data is stored on this device and does not imply cloud history or synchronization.

Independent-review corrections now distinguish a stable practice-round presentation from semantic Language word/token identity. A repeated Soccer or Tower presentation of the same word and token starts again at attempt index 1, while retries inside that presentation increment normally and the persisted item ID remains semantic. The same correction pass made dynamic user-visible `String` production explicitly localized, including Soccer/Tower feedback and accessibility, hub subtitles, Parent/Progress paths, shared choice/build/memory feedback, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Ping Pong status copy. The current validator reports 592 keys in both catalogs across their 11/10-locale policies; newly added non-English fallback values remain `needs_review` rather than being represented as linguistically reviewed.

Records / Streaks now reads only the matching local reward-ledger scope. It shows actual current and best streak values when a ledger entry exists and an explicit empty state otherwise. It does not display or infer Math points, invent record history, or imply cloud synchronization.

The preferred Windows-accessible macOS gate is the manual-only GitHub Actions **iOS Simulator Build** workflow. Its only trigger is `workflow_dispatch`, with no partial-product or skip-test inputs: one macOS job attempts all four product builds and packages, records compile and package state separately, and runs ProductConfigurationTests exactly once using MinikPlus DerivedData only when all four compilations are clean. It then selects and boots one available modern iPhone Simulator and, for every built app, reads the real bundle identifier from that app's `Info.plist`, installs and launches it, waits for initial rendering, verifies the process remains present, captures a screenshot and console/process diagnostics, and terminates it before the next product. Four separately derived unsigned, universal Simulator ZIP artifacts remain; package-ready products still upload if a sibling fails. Three-day build-log, XCTest, and aggregate smoke-evidence artifacts preserve Simulator details, launch/console/process logs, screenshots, post-start crash reports, and a JSON per-product result without uploading DerivedData. A final step fails on any required compile, package, XCTest, Simulator, or smoke failure after all possible attempts and uploads. No signing credentials, production-service secrets, external test service, Maestro installation, or hosted AppStoreCommerceKit grace-period test is part of this gate. Historical non-GitHub configurations are not an approved validation path.

The second deliberate GitHub-hosted gate ran with Xcode 26.6 and iPhoneSimulator 26.5. All four requested products reached real Swift/resource compilation: the earlier `FoundationXML` blocker did not recur, String Catalog and asset-catalog compilation were reached, and the universal arm64 + x86_64 Simulator path was exercised. All four then failed on the same `PingPongScene` no-argument initializer missing its required `override` keyword and emitted the same `TicTacToeFeedbackPlayer` main-actor conformance warning. No product reached package-ready state, ProductConfigurationTests correctly did not run because the requested build set was not compile-clean, and no Simulator smoke test passed. The two diagnostics were corrected in `085d704`.

The third deliberate GitHub-hosted gate checked out exactly `085d704f5e8451ac9bc4456b4b521e6a64227c3b` and used Xcode 26.6 with iPhoneSimulator 26.5. XcodeGen succeeded and all four product schemes were attempted. `FoundationXML` remained fixed and the prior `PingPongScene` missing-`override` error remained fixed. All four builds nevertheless failed, exposing five distinct Swift compiler errors in `ParentAreaView`, `SoccerSession`, `LanguageWordCardsContentProvider`, `LanguageWordLevelContent`, and `MathM9ContentProvider`; `TicTacToeFeedbackPlayer` also continued to emit its delegate-conformance concurrency warning. No requested product became package-ready, ProductConfigurationTests did not run, and no Simulator smoke test has passed. This correction checkpoint addresses only those diagnosed source issues and the two other concrete Minik Swift warnings reported by the same run; a clean rerun remains pending. C1 and C2 remain Windows-static audited only, and C3 remains the first incomplete Language release audit.

The fourth deliberate GitHub-hosted gate checked out exactly `898a8e652691451b63fedad952ce4f81bf16b2a8` and used Xcode 26.6. The previous five Gate-3 compiler errors no longer recurred, and the previous Tic-Tac-Toe concurrency warning no longer recurred. The complete log contained four `error:` occurrences representing exactly two unique Swift source errors: `LanguageWordCardsContentProvider` used the wrong `LearningTextRepresentation` argument-label order, and `PairsView.mixedBoard` lacked an explicit return for its `LazyVGrid` modifier chain. All four requested builds still failed, no product was packaged, ProductConfigurationTests did not run, and a clean rerun remains pending.

The fifth deliberate GitHub-hosted gate checked out exactly `7bc15113f3c2b77dfbe3856558e4caf5e647c538` and used Xcode 26.6. MinikPlus, MinikPlusEnglish, MinikMath, and MinikPingPong all reported BUILD SUCCEEDED; all four Simulator ZIPs were successfully packaged and uploaded. The ProductConfigurationTests phase started, but test-target compilation failed before XCTest execution on exactly one unique compiler error: `LanguageWordLevelContentTests.swift` omitted the now-required `stableKey` argument when constructing `LanguageVocabularyImageManifestEntry`. The same test compile emitted one Minik warning because interpolating optional `androidWordID` produced a debug description. No XCTest assertions executed, so full CI green is not yet established; a clean Mac test rerun remains pending.

The sixth deliberate GitHub-hosted gate checked out exactly `b1c3e811da1dc72e3c0204c82e6c9596b8d85a9c` and used Xcode 26.6. MinikPlus reported BUILD SUCCEEDED, the ProductConfigurationTests target compiled, its XCTest bundle loaded in the Simulator, and 763 tests executed—the first real full ProductConfigurationTests execution. The run reported 18 assertion/error occurrences and exactly 8 unique failing test methods. The supplied correction brief nevertheless enumerates nine method names because it lists both ActivityProgress methods separately; this correction covers every enumerated method: `testTicTacToeIsAJustForFunGameInBothLanguageProductsOnly`; `testLocalRepositoryPersistsAndRestoresVersionedSnapshot`; `testReducerAggregatesAttemptsOutcomesCompletionAndDuration`; `testBuiltDisplayTextRestoresWhitespaceWhenFollowingTokenIsAccepted`; `testWhitespaceIsNotDraggableAndProgressiveDisplayPreservesIt`; `testExpectedVisibleSequenceReconstructsExactLearnedWord`; `testCatalogMigratesLevelAFruitsInAndroidSourceOrder`; `testM3BuildKeepsTheMissingValueTaskInsideTheBuildInteraction`; and `testDecorativeAreaIsNotPlayableTableInput`. The failures are stale or numerically over-exact test assumptions, including one already-correct dirty Phase-41 test hunk; repository evidence found no production defect. A clean macOS XCTest rerun remains required before claiming the suite passes.

**Gate #6 correction addendum — 2026-09-05:** The historical assertion that every named test was corrected is superseded for M3 Build. `27ccca2` replaced a wrong structure-ID parser with a typed-prompt assertion for the wrong factory. The latest real run passed 796/797 tests and failed that assertion. Source tracing establishes TEST_DEFECT, with no random-value dependency. The older factory's semantic test is now corrected, while new dedicated M3 tests enforce the unchanged typed production contract. See [root-cause evidence](m3-build-xctest-root-cause.md); repaired XCTest execution remains pending.

`project.yml` currently gives the `MinikApplication` template the complete `Sources` directory, so every application target compiles Language, Math, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Ping Pong sources even when runtime product routing excludes those features. This explains why both diagnostics appeared in all four products. Runtime product policy is not thereby incorrect. A target-source split may reduce compile coupling and build time, but it requires a separate dependency analysis and is deferred to a coherent build-architecture unit.

All current workflows under `.github/workflows/` are manual-only after corrective checkpoint `5b64a3a`. The pre-existing **iOS CI** workflow had been the only file with automatic `push` and `pull_request` triggers; those triggers were removed without changing its build/test logic or the separate Phase 41 benchmark work.

The reviewer-supplied log for GitHub Actions run `91194820829` establishes the first concrete Apple compile failure: XcodeGen completed, then MinikPlus compilation could not resolve `FoundationXML` because `LanguageVocabularyCatalogLoader.swift` imported that split module unconditionally. Checkpoint `8eac5e6` keeps `Foundation` unconditional and imports `FoundationXML` only when `canImport(FoundationXML)`, preserving the existing `XMLParser` behavior across Darwin and non-Darwin toolchains.

The Windows-static portion of C1 Learn Letters is now audited against Android. Language Learn preserves the exact 26-card English and 27-card Hebrew sequences, examples, illustration identifiers, final-form speech metadata, letter-then-word speech/replay, learned-language product policy, and Android's full-alphabet instructional policy. Its final action now uses the reviewed localized “Start over” copy and loops to the first card instead of ending. The generic Learn engine retains complete-after-final behavior for non-Language callers. The focused audit and remaining device gates are recorded in `docs/language-learn-release-audit.md`; the missing decorative Android lowercase/capital letter-mascot artwork remains an explicit visual parity decision/blocker.

The Windows-static portion of C2 Letter Pairs is now audited against Android. Its production route presents four semantic learned-language initial groups as eight globally unique mixed image tiles, permits any-two selection without leaking internal left/right identities, speaks each newly selected physical tile's English/Hebrew learned word, loops to a fresh board after completion, and records replay-safe semantic attempts plus the verified Android `+1/-1` points rule without a streak. Generic column-based Pairs behavior, including Math, remains unchanged. Evidence and remaining macOS/device/shared-feedback gates are in `docs/language-letter-pairs-release-audit.md`.

The Windows-static portion of C3 First Letter picture→letter is now audited against Android. It preserves image-ready same-category prompts, four distinct plausible initial choices, English/Hebrew learned-language speech, six-challenge retry-until-correct progression, and product language policy. The production route now uses the localized starting-letter instruction, exposes the actual pictured learned word to VoiceOver, and records the stable expected initial concept while keeping the UUID-based challenge instance separate for retries/lifecycle. Evidence and remaining Apple-platform gates are in `docs/language-first-letter-choice-release-audit.md`.

The Windows-static portion of C4 First Letter letter→picture is now audited against Android. It preserves one English/Hebrew initial prompt, four unique image-ready same-category pictures with distinct plausible initials, learned-word choice speech, six-challenge retry-until-correct progression, and exact initial-concept correctness. The production route now uses its localized picture-matching instruction, exposes each pictured learned word to VoiceOver, and records stable semantic progress separate from challenge-instance identity. Evidence and remaining Apple-platform gates are in `docs/language-first-letter-picture-release-audit.md`.

The Windows-static portion of C5 Picture→Word is now audited against Android. It preserves one image-ready prompt, four distinct same-category English/Hebrew learned-word choices, prompt/replay and choice speech, six-challenge retry-until-correct progression, exact vocabulary-word correctness, and product policy. The production route now uses its localized picture-to-word instruction, exposes the actual pictured learned word to VoiceOver, and records stable vocabulary identity separate from challenge-instance identity. Evidence and remaining Apple-platform gates are in `docs/language-picture-to-word-release-audit.md`.

The Windows-static portion of C6 Word→Picture is now audited against Android. It preserves one English/Hebrew learned-word prompt, four distinct image-ready same-category choices, prompt/replay and choice speech, six-challenge retry-until-correct progression, exact vocabulary-word correctness, and product policy. The production route now uses its localized word-to-picture instruction, exposes each pictured learned word to VoiceOver, and records stable vocabulary identity separate from challenge-instance identity. Evidence and remaining Apple-platform gates are in `docs/language-word-to-picture-release-audit.md`.

The Windows-static portion of C7 Build Word is now audited against Android. It preserves unique physical duplicate letters, immediate-prefix correctness, retryable unconsumed errors, English/Hebrew direction and speech, six image-ready challenges, and product policy. Typed word-build content retains exact whitespace while exposing only visible letter tokens; the UI restores progressive spaces, uses word-specific Minik presentation/accessibility, and now records the immediate per-token attempts that were previously absent. Evidence and remaining Apple-platform gates are in `docs/language-build-word-release-audit.md`.

The Windows-static portion of C8 Mixed is now audited against Android. It preserves the approved repeating 20 Word-to-Picture / 10 Picture-to-Word / 5 Word Build schedule, advances only for real child challenge transitions, atomically rolls back a failed mode change, and uses capability-enabled Level A content. Each child now receives its activity-specific presentation instead of a generic choice/build presentation. Choice modes retain learned-language speech, retry indices, and stable vocabulary identity; Word Build retains immediate-prefix per-token evidence under `.mixed`; no Math fields are introduced. Evidence and remaining Apple-platform gates are in `docs/language-mixed-release-audit.md`.

The Windows-static portions of C9 Word Cards and C10 Soccer are now audited against Android. C9 restores the dedicated Cards composition and identity-guarded manual/timed continuous shuffled flow without graded attempts. C10 now uses a dedicated Language-only drag game rather than the old shared tap/random presentation: real drag-vector football flight, shared-coordinate goal/keeper/post/crossbar collision, rebound, shot-identity exact-once finalization, the Android score matrix and retry/duplicate/continuous-word semantics, specialized telemetry, speech, lifecycle cancellation, RTL/LTR, accessibility fallback, and Reduce Motion. Persisted Parent Soccer A/B/C drives Android-derived keeper size, initial motion pattern, sweep timing/range, and post-ten-shot performance adjustment. Math Soccer is unchanged. Its typed full-pool boundary now feeds the separately audited Android-derived global Language Auto word-level mechanism. Evidence and remaining Apple-platform gates are in `docs/language-word-cards-release-audit.md` and `docs/language-soccer-release-audit.md`.

The Windows-static portions of C11 Tower and C12 Picture Memory are now audited against Android. C11 now uses a dedicated Language-only exact pastel scene with the original sitting gift-block mascot, sand and pile; scattered physical blocks; locked base; bottom-up semantic stack including whitespace spacers; non-consuming failure sound; completion confetti; final letter-to-word speech; typed telemetry; fixed verified +2 reward; and presentation-scoped continuous-round cancellation. The generic Math Tower path is unchanged. C12 locks the Games grouping, blank gradient card backs, physical-versus-semantic identity, image-to-identical-image pairs, exact-once accepted reveal speech, silent generic Math path, continuation/completion behavior, accessibility, and responsive grid. Evidence and remaining Apple-platform gates are in `docs/language-tower-release-audit.md`, the reconstruction ledger/crosswalk, and `docs/language-picture-memory-release-audit.md`.

The Windows-static portion of C13 Tic-Tac-Toe is now audited against the complete live Android source and layouts. Its dedicated just-for-fun route restores the exact pastel panel, board-holding gameplay mascot, inside branded close, gradient title, X/O controls and complete purple/pink/teal-edged white 3x3 board without ordinary-phone scrolling. Child-first rules, all seven level identities, Android Random/Adaptive compatibility, synchronous single AI response, hidden cumulative game scores, feedback/speech/sounds, accessibility, RTL-safe spatial board, and lifecycle/Reduce Motion behavior remain intact. The session score invariant persists across rounds, but no score is rendered to the child and no mastery event is emitted. Evidence and remaining Apple-platform gates are in `docs/language-tic-tac-toe-release-audit.md`.

The post-C14 independent-review correction also reconciles Soccer's instruction contract with the actual iOS interaction. Android uses a drag-across-release-line gesture, while the intentional iOS implementation uses native buttons for one-action tap-to-kick. The 11 Full and 10 English Only interface-locale introductions now describe tap only, and the same localized String is used for visible and spoken instructions. Soccer scoring, ordered-token correctness/retry behavior, speech, telemetry, and Math Soccer remain unchanged.

C14 now locks all 13 production Language identities together at Windows-static level. The machine-audited record captures Android behavior/reference sources, exact menu art/provenance, section and session identity, speech, progress/reward and retry rules, lifecycle, accessibility, RTL/LTR, and an explicit pending runtime gate for every activity. The lock rejects Picture Memory section drift, child-visible generic engines, incomplete/wrong production artwork, a child-Home learned-language selector, graded Cards/Tic-Tac-Toe, lost Soccer/Tower semantic telemetry, and false runtime-confirmed claims. Evidence is in `docs/language-production-parity-lock.md` and `docs/language-production-parity-lock.tsv`.

Gate #6 runtime QA observations remain separate from the XCTest correction. Their current Windows-static disposition is:

- The shared Language visual foundation, illustration-led Home/Learn surfaces, and original Minik activity art are implemented; focused activity audits and Apple-device visual confirmation remain incomplete.
- Picture Memory is now grouped under Games in production and covered by a deterministic catalog test; runtime menu confirmation remains pending.
- Soccer balls now render their ordered-token letters over the original field/goalkeeper art; runtime layout and interaction confirmation remain pending.
- Shared success/failure feedback and reduced-motion-safe reactions are implemented; timing and presentation still require runtime confirmation.
- Language speech sources and lifecycle paths pass the static audit, but audible output in Appetize/on device remains unconfirmed.
- Ping Pong serve targeting now uses root-scene coordinates and the original table/mascot composition; runtime feel and hit targeting remain pending.
- Ping Pong typography and composition were corrected statically but still require iPhone/iPad visual confirmation.

**Completed no-CI audit units:** Windows-static portions of Language C1-C14, including the post-C14 independent-review corrections; D1-D2 English Only hardening; and the focused Math visual-consistency pass. Math now has an activity-by-activity M1/M5/M10 visual record across all 13 identities, shared Math frame/light surfaces, branded close/replay/feedback boundaries, precise typed representations, and explicit LTR mathematics without learned-language state. There is no Android Math authority, and no Math curriculum, correctness, progression, reward, or telemetry behavior changed. The clean macOS rerun, ProductConfigurationTests, and every recorded runtime/device/independent-review gate remain required before any release-complete claim. Those historical audit units did not add automatic triggers, caches, signing, Firebase, StoreKit, ads, notifications, or unapproved Math reward values; later explicitly assigned release-integration work is recorded separately below.

Updated Android implementation, administrator archive/clear cutover, Rules/index deployment, App Check registration/metrics/enforcement decision, legal/policy review, and macOS/backend validation remain
- [~] I1–I2 Notifications — Parent-only opt-in, persisted weekly local reminder, lifecycle repair, disable/cancel, localized copy, and deterministic source tests implemented; Xcode/device authorization and delivery validation plus final cadence/copy approval remain
- [~] J0–J6 Ads/StoreKit/remove ads — reusable package retained; app startup/update/foreground reconciliation, injected non-consumable Remove Ads configuration, cached entitlement, gated Parent purchase/restore/status, and deterministic source tests implemented. The Google provider adapter and shared ad-service boundary fail closed behind explicit enablement, child-policy approval and injected provider IDs, reject known sample/test identifiers, apply child-directed/under-age/G/non-personalized configuration, suppress on `remove_ads`, and receive Android-derived Language plus owner-approved Ping Pong opportunities. The Android-derived two-day/fourteen-day reminder is source-integrated and can appear only when real ads and a loaded purchase are available.

- [~] O1–O7 App Store/TestFlight/release — per-target bundle/version/icon configuration, production Language Firebase plists, a shared explicit version/build strategy, and a four-product checklist classified as repo-ready/owner action/Mac-required are checked in; Apple/Firebase/AdMob account actions, signing, final metadata, screenshots, archives, TestFlight, review submission, and production verification remain external/runtime work

## 30. Known open product decisions

Do not silently choose these:

1. Exact higher-level representation breakpoints and content pools within the confirmed M2–M10 curriculum.
2. Exact per-level Math Mixed cadence and Cards/facts pacing within their confirmed contracts.
3. Final profile model: one child vs multiple child profiles.
4. Final legal/consent/privacy-policy wording, retention policy, and deployed-rule approval for the public leaderboard.
5. App Store category/age-band strategy and resulting advertising/analytics constraints.
6. Remove Ads business model if anything other than one-time non-consumable is desired.
7. Notification cadence/copy.
8. Final App Store listings and product IDs.

## 31. Current release blockers

- The current XCTest gate remains red: the latest supplied Xcode 26.6 / Swift 6.3.3 run built all four apps and executed 797 tests, with one M3 Build failure. The older-factory assertion introduced by `27ccca2` was deterministically wrong; this checkpoint corrects it and adds typed production regressions without production changes. Windows/static evidence cannot establish that the repaired tests compile and pass. A future authorized Mac rerun is still required.
- All four targets currently compile the complete `Sources` directory through the shared `MinikApplication` template. This is a compile-time coupling/optimization issue requiring later dependency analysis, not evidence of incorrect runtime product routing.
- Canonical Apple bundle IDs are source-configured for all four apps and the test bundle. Matching production Language Firebase plists are source-wired with pre-copy bundle-ID validation, and Release App Attest source configuration/entitlement is present. Apple Developer/App Store Connect registration, Firebase App Check app registration/metrics, any approved AdMob iOS app registration/IDs, signing, and archive validation remain external gates.
- M1–M10 have twelve functional educational activities each, but macOS/Xcode/Simulator validation and final visual/content tuning remain required.
- The Math contract is user-confirmed, but exact higher-level pools/tuning still require activity-by-activity authoring and review.
- Educational Parent Area, local Progress / Statistics, local and remote Records / Streaks, specialized Language Soccer/Tower telemetry, reminders, gated commerce, and gated configurable privacy/terms/support/version information are implemented at source level. Production URLs/content, backend account configuration, and macOS/device validation remain incomplete.
- The reusable StoreKit package is integrated into all shared-source targets. The app observes transaction updates at startup, refreshes at startup/foreground, supports explicit restore, maps the injected non-consumable to `remove_ads`, persists a launch cache, and exposes purchase/restore/status behind a randomized adult arithmetic gate in Parent Area for MinikPlus, MinikPlusEnglish, and MinikMath. Standalone MinikPingPong has no commerce surface, so its ads must remain disabled absent a separately authorized UX decision. The production Google adapter, deterministic cadence, and Android-derived reminder policy are source-integrated but fail closed until App Store category/age-band policy, explicit enablement, and real iOS AdMob app/unit IDs are supplied; known sample/test identifiers are rejected. App Store Connect setup and StoreKit/Xcode/ad-device validation remain incomplete.
- Local learning reminders are implemented at source level with a default-off Parent toggle, contextual Apple permission request, conservative weekly repeating schedule, per-product persistence, lifecycle-safe repair, cancellation, and localized privacy-safe copy. Xcode/device authorization, Settings-revocation, delivery, locale-change, and final cadence/copy approval remain incomplete.
- Final localization QA incomplete: the deterministic source/catalog audit is zero, but newly supplied fallback entries still require native-language linguistic review.
- C1 Learn Letters is Windows-statically audited, but macOS speech/lifecycle, iPhone/iPad, VoiceOver, mixed RTL/LTR, and native-language QA remain. Android's 106 decorative lowercase/capital letter-mascot drawables are not represented in the tracked iOS asset catalog; iOS currently uses native letter text, so that visual difference requires explicit approval or asset work.
- C2 Letter Pairs is Windows-statically audited, but macOS compilation/XCTest plus device speech, rapid-interaction, points persistence, VoiceOver, mixed RTL/LTR, layout, and final shared success/failure feedback QA remain.
- C3 First Letter picture→letter is Windows-statically audited, but macOS compilation/XCTest plus device image rendering, English/Hebrew speech, retry timing, VoiceOver, mixed RTL/LTR, Dynamic Type, and final visual QA remain.
- C4 First Letter letter→picture is Windows-statically audited, but macOS compilation/XCTest plus device image rendering, English/Hebrew speech, retry timing, VoiceOver, mixed RTL/LTR, Dynamic Type, and final visual QA remain.
- C5 Picture→Word is Windows-statically audited, but macOS compilation/XCTest plus device image rendering, long-word layout, English/Hebrew speech, retry timing, VoiceOver, mixed RTL/LTR, Dynamic Type, and final visual QA remain.
- C6 Word→Picture is Windows-statically audited, but macOS compilation/XCTest plus device image rendering/grid, English/Hebrew speech, retry timing, VoiceOver, mixed RTL/LTR, Dynamic Type, and final visual QA remain.
- C7 Build Word is Windows-statically audited, but macOS compilation/XCTest plus device tap/drag, duplicate-letter and multiword interaction, English/Hebrew speech sequencing, VoiceOver/keyboard/Switch Control, mixed RTL/LTR, Dynamic Type, and final visual QA remain.
- C8 Mixed is Windows-statically audited, but macOS compilation/XCTest plus device 20/10/5 transitions, continuous repeat, English/Hebrew speech, retry/telemetry exactness, VoiceOver/keyboard/Switch Control, mixed RTL/LTR, Dynamic Type, and final visual QA remain.
- C9 Word Cards is Windows-statically audited, but macOS compilation/XCTest plus device background/card/mascot composition, manual-versus-timed advance, continuous bags, long/multiword fit, English/Hebrew speech, VoiceOver/keyboard/Switch Control, mixed RTL/LTR, Dynamic Type, and final visual QA remain.
- The approved Math object/zero/grouping pack and native exact fraction bars, number lines, percent/ratio, probability, and geometry representations are integrated through M10. Xcode asset compilation plus device-scale visual, interaction, accessibility, and pedagogical QA remain incomplete.
- Firebase iOS records integration is implemented at source level for Minik Plus and English Only with the shared Android collections/public fields, anonymous-auth-gated transport, top-20 reads, atomic multi-record writes when both qualify, cache/error/configuration states, recoverable pending publication, and secure ownership that keeps `player_id` distinct from `auth.uid`. Each product/profile receives a persisted versioned UUID; `leaderboard_owners/{player_id}` contains only the private immutable `owner_uid`; one UID can own multiple profiles; legacy IDs cannot be claimed; and ownership is proven before write/delete. Local child names have no remote path, aliases/avatars remain curated, Parent can change the alias from generated choices, and deletion preserves local data. The isolated Language plists, Release App Attest, strict Rules/indexes, migration runbook, and Android file-level handoff exist. Strict deployment still requires the administrator archive/clear cutover and an updated Android release because legacy records have no Auth ownership and legacy Android accepts free-text `user_name`. Firebase Console/Auth/App Check actions, emulator/backend/device validation, final legal/retention wording, and live privacy publication remain incomplete.
- App Store policy/category/child privacy gate incomplete.

# PART X — DECISION LOG (APPEND ONLY)

Future ChatGPT/Codex sessions must append confirmed changes rather than rewriting history.

### 2026-08-30 — Product architecture correction

**Confirmed by user:**

- Android has no Math product; stop searching Android for Math curriculum.
- Math must reuse/parallel the richness of the existing activity families, not be reduced to seven generic engines.
- Math had been defined here with Tic-Tac-Toe as item 13; that item alone was explicitly superseded on 2026-08-31 by Ping Pong. The other twelve activity identities remain unchanged.
- Final Math quantity visuals use beautiful object art rather than generic dots.
- Higher values must use grouped/symbolic representations rather than hundreds of repeated objects.
- four-choice distractors must be plausible, unique, and include the correct answer exactly once.
- Math Soccer uses a fixed answer-ball pool with changing questions and the same educational/shot score matrix as Android Soccer.
- Math Tower builds a target count/value and uses extra available blocks plus a delayed stable-correct completion window.
- two Math simple construction activities replace the two Language first-letter-specific activities.
- Learn is instructional and separate from practice.
- the full app includes success animations, TTS, points/streaks/records, Firebase, Parent Area, progress, ads, remove-ads reminder/purchase, notifications, English Only, localization and App Store release work.
- App Store purchasing should be encapsulated in a separate reusable library for other applications.

### 2026-08-31 — Ping Pong, Math visual identity, and fourth product

**Confirmed by user:**

- Language Just-for-Fun remains Tic-Tac-Toe; Math Just-for-Fun is Ping Pong.
- Math still has 13 production activities, with Ping Pong replacing Tic-Tac-Toe as item 13; Ping Pong is outside Math curriculum/provider state.
- `MinikPingPong` is the fourth product and contains only the Ping Pong experience plus future shared monetization/code actions.
- Ping Pong has Starter/Easy/Medium/Hard, with Starter drag-to-ball and Tap/Swipe selection for Easy/Medium/Hard.
- Tap, Swipe, serves, legal bounce/net/out flight, incoming-shot-aware Minik AI, targets, scoring, service rotation, approved artwork mapping, persistence, accessibility, and lifecycle follow §7.13.
- `math_frame_background` is the centralized Minik Math practice frame; Language visuals remain unchanged and Ping Pong uses its arena.
- Ads/commerce/code redemption must remain shared host services; Ping Pong only exposes a narrow completed-match/action boundary and never fakes success.

### 2026-08-31 — Confirmed Math product, M1, progression, localization, and fit contracts

**Confirmed by user:**

- Level is WHAT is learned and activity is HOW it is practiced; all thirteen Math identities remain present at every level, with Ping Pong non-curriculum.
- The M1–M10 curriculum is the progression recorded in §8 and the matrix; Android is not Math curriculum authority.
- M1 spans 0...10 and numeral↔quantity/cardinality across twelve educational activities; Build Math is the ordered counting chain `1→...→N` and does not duplicate Build Number or Build Quantity.
- low-level Build Number uses draggable numeral tokens and no iOS keyboard; repeated future digits require distinct physical token IDs.
- Tower supports Count Tower for readable small answers and Answer Token Tower for larger/structured answers; M1 shows a numeral, always supplies extra blocks, uses explicit buzzer submission, supports correction and zero, has no completion countdown, and preserves speaker/replay behavior.
- zero quantity uses a neutral empty scene with no numeral answer leakage.
- Math Mixed excludes Learn/Cards/Ping Pong from graded child modes; Cards remains instructional/review with manual/shuffle/timed behavior.
- Math level mode defaults to Automatic; Manual never auto-changes. Starting calibration is three attempts with +2/+1/down tuning, normal promotion is 8 consecutive or 18/20 first-attempt correct, demotion is 7 consecutive failures or at most 8/20 correct, promotion probation is 6 attempts/4 failures, cooldown is 10 attempts, and time is only a family-specific secondary signal with >120 seconds recorded as very slow.
- automatic routing is clamped to implementation-ready levels; the child hub is not a level picker and future Parent Area owns Manual selection.
- activity progress application must be replay-idempotent and typed attempt data must carry stable identity, attempt index, result, duration, family, and optional Math level/skill without forcing Math fields into Language.
- every user-visible Swift string must be resource-localized before release. Supported interface locales are English, Amharic, Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Dutch, Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, and Russian; English Only excludes Hebrew.
- mathematical content must never truncate. Fit uses a readable minimum, last-resort two-line layout, bounded 12-candidate regeneration, and a localized retry state rather than ellipsis or infinite loops.
- final M1 quantities require a separately generated/approved child-friendly object-art pack governed by the permanent requirements handoff; procedural dots/shapes remain development-only.

### 2026-09-06 — Owner requires complete Language Android reconstruction

The entire Language product and meaningful states must match all 16 binding Android references and actual source/assets, including discrepancies absent from owner annotations. This explicitly supersedes the tap-only Language Soccer adaptation: drag/aim/launch and physical outcomes are required, preserving the four-row educational-correctness × goal-result score contract. Native accessibility/safe areas cannot justify generic replacement compositions. No Math or English Only architecture change. Source implementation and real runtime verification are separate gates.

### 2026-09-13 — GitHub-hosted Simulator validation only

**Confirmed by user:**

- GitHub Actions is the only approved hosted Simulator validation service; Codemagic, Appetize, BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, and other external services are not used.
- The preferred workflow remains manual-only and every dispatch is a complete four-product gate, with one ProductConfigurationTests invocation after compile-clean builds.
- One GitHub-hosted modern iPhone Simulator must validate install, launch, stable initial rendering, screenshots, diagnostics, and clean termination for all built products before an aggregate verdict.
- The gate must preserve partial successful ZIP evidence, collect runtime evidence for review, require no signing or production-service credentials, and must not run the hosted AppStoreCommerceKit grace-period test.

---

### 2026-09-13 — Public leaderboard privacy model

**Confirmed by user:**

- Real/local child profile names remain local-only and must never be uploaded or used as the Firebase identity.
- Public leaderboard identity is an app-curated adjective + noun + number alias with an optional curated avatar; no free text, real-name field, photo, or initials-by-default path is permitted.
- The first eligible best score is celebrated and retained locally. It remains pending until one-time Parent approval; approval publishes it and permits later qualifying uploads without repeated approval.
- Parent Area owns persistent, grown-up-gated participation enable/disable and participant-record deletion. Disabling stops future uploads immediately, while deletion leaves local progress and records intact.
- Firebase anonymous authentication remains transport-only. The Android-compatible collections and legacy field names remain, but `user_name` contains only the generated public alias and the remote payload is restricted to opaque participant ID, public alias/avatar, score/streak, product/app ID, and timestamp.

---

### 2026-09-13 — Public leaderboard alias activation supersedes mandatory approval

**Confirmed by user:**

- Do not request a public alias during onboarding. The first leaderboard-qualifying score offers only curated generated aliases.
- Selecting an alias activates public leaderboard participation for that local profile and immediately attempts to publish the pending qualifying score. Future qualifying scores reuse the same selected alias.
- A separate persistent Parent approval is no longer required merely to select or use the curated alias. Parent Area retains direct, persistent Online leaderboard On/Off and participant-record deletion controls.
- No upload occurs before alias selection. A Parent opt-out stops future uploads and cannot be overridden by child alias selection; public-record deletion leaves local progress and local records intact.
- The local-name exclusion, no-free-text boundary, minimum remote field allowlist, and remaining owner/legal review gate are unchanged.

---

### 2026-09-13 — Canonical production Apple bundle identifiers

**Confirmed by user:**

- MinikPlus: `com.appsbybros.minik.plus`
- MinikPlusEnglish: `com.appsbybros.minik.plus.english`
- MinikMath: `com.appsbybros.minik.math`
- MinikPingPong: `com.appsbybros.minik.pingpong`
- ProductConfigurationTests: `com.appsbybros.minik.tests`
- These identifiers apply only to Apple/iOS configuration. Android application IDs remain unchanged, and the existing StoreKit product identifier remains `remove_ads`.

---

### 2026-09-14 — Secure multi-profile leaderboard ownership and legacy cutover

**Confirmed by user:**

- Firebase anonymous `auth.uid` is transport/ownership identity and must never replace the distinct opaque `player_id` for a local child profile; one Auth UID may own multiple profile IDs.
- Active clients use private `leaderboard_owners/{player_id}` bindings. Ownership is not publicly enumerable/displayed, another UID cannot transfer or use it, and public documents retain only the established Android-compatible fields.
- Historical UUIDs have no cryptographic owner and must never be claimed by a client based only on a public `player_id`. Updated profiles use new versioned opaque IDs and can republish retained local bests.
- The coordinated migration archives/verifies legacy public data, clears the active ranking during an administrator-controlled cutover, deploys strict ownership Rules, and moves both platforms to curated aliases without deleting local progress/rewards.
- App Check enforcement remains a separate later step after updated Apple and Android clients are registered, released, and healthy in metrics.

## 2026-09-28 — Modern Full/Simple and Apple Firebase registration

Owner decision: port the current standalone Android Modern Ping Pong to native iOS, including online/tournaments/ads and Apple purchases; provide a parameter selecting a simple house-player match that returns to its host when complete. Neither new entry point contains 80s. Do not change existing 80s gameplay or use the attached Pixels. The owner confirmed no Ping Pong Apple Firebase registration existed and instructed us to create the setup together. A dedicated Apple app was registered in existing `minikswish`; no production rules were deployed and no TripleShot paths were changed. The existing Math host is not rerouted as part of this Modern-only unit.

## 2026-09-28 — Shared Retro game, Math entries and local commits

Owner decision: commit the completed Modern work for the owner to push; bring current Android 80’s gameplay/UI/audio to iOS; keep both Modern and 80’s accessible from Math. Add a standalone 80’s entry with the same game/features and no feature-mode switch. Modern remains a shared Full/Simple implementation. Do not add ads to 80’s; existing Modern ads may remain, with a common library planned later. Android is read-only and attached Pixels remain off limits. A native WKWebView host reuses the current Android 80’s web payload to preserve its exact engine, assets and responsive behavior; host callbacks affect navigation only.

Status: implemented and statically audited; remote run-log failure detail remains unavailable in this environment
Commit(s): `5b64a3a` (`checkpoint: make GitHub iOS validation manual only`)
Files changed: removed only `push` and `pull_request` from the pre-existing **iOS CI** trigger; expanded the workflow audit to reject automatic triggers in every current workflow file
Tests run: all four workflow files read completely; directory-wide trigger audit reports zero automatic-trigger errors; simulator workflow input/test/product/artifact/retention contract remains green; staged diff and status reviewed
Remote diagnosis: run/job ID `91194820829` returned 404 through unauthenticated and available stored-credential API access, and GitHub CLI is not installed, so no compiler/test-log cause is claimed
Preserved work: Phase 41 benchmark workflow and benchmark implementation were not staged or altered by this checkpoint
Remaining blocker: obtain the failed run log from an account with repository Actions access before making any build/project correction attributed to that run
Reviewer result: automatic quota consumption from current workflow triggers is prevented once this checkpoint is pushed; no remote workflow was triggered, rerun, canceled, or otherwise mutated

Files changed: tap-serve horizontal lane derivation; child-baseline serve-paddle animation; non-playable top-band Minik placement; rounded HUD typography; deterministic serve and coordinate assertions; first-Simulator ledger
Tests run: standard Windows audit suite and source compatibility audit; XCTest/Simulator not run on Windows
Tests authored: center aim, left/right preservation, tap-selected primary bounce depth, derived own/opponent bounce sides; existing decorative-area and invertible table-coordinate coverage retained
Mac validation: required for serve feel/trajectory, touch-to-table calibration, common iPhone/iPad composition, typography, and gameplay obstruction
Product decisions made by user: none; Tap still accepts the full legal table, child-half taps define the first bounce, Minik-half taps define the receiver bounce, and difficulty assistance/out behavior is preserved
Remaining blockers: complete Language speech-path audit, remaining activity/Parent Area visuals, C3–C14, Math consistency review, and existing release gates

Status: source repair and Windows compile-risk audit complete; Xcode confirmation pending
Commit(s): local checkpoint containing this entry, `checkpoint: repair shared practice visual compile defect`
Files changed: two choice-style identifier references; focused source-contract audit and Language visual-audit integration; detailed 56-file compile-risk evidence; current gate status
Root cause: `a90e0a0` added idle border conditions using helper-local `state` outside its scope; the component has always stored `feedbackState`
Tests run: all 20 applicable Windows/static scripts, seven focused in-memory regression mutations, and diff checks; no Swift parser/compiler, Xcode, XCTest, or Simulator execution available in this session
Mac validation: required for all four schemes and ProductConfigurationTests; the supplied failed run checked out exactly `d6b3cbfad3a0cd5f9fe872a5965beac77ac7d846`
Product decisions made by user: none; idle gradient, feedback colors/widths, accessibility, and product routes preserved
Remaining blockers: clean Mac compile/test rerun and existing release gates; no additional concrete compile defect found in `b1c3e81..d6b3cbf`

### 2026-09-05 - Cards accessibility second Mac failure / red-team correction

Sprint name: Root-cause the shared Cards API failure and correct the previous review process
Commit(s): local checkpoint containing this entry, `checkpoint: repair Cards SwiftUI accessibility compile defect`
Files changed: one Cards accessibility expression; focused six-mutation API guard and Word Cards integration; corrected prior analysis; new evidence-separated audit; living plan status
Behavior changed: the existing tap surface explicitly supplies the default accessibility action and calls the same manual advance operation; timing, speech, lifecycle, visuals and activity mechanics remain intact
Validation performed: all 21 applicable Windows audits passed; entire 133-file Sources scan and repeated 56-file committed Swift review; selective staged diff and preservation checks recorded in the external export
Mac validation: pending for all four schemes and ProductConfigurationTests; supplied failed run was exactly `d2d8d79deeb51cb65dc92a8a1d82187849e9cc75`
Review correction: previous Cards overload-resolution wording exceeded its evidence and missed this invalid call; authoritative API shapes and real-compiler uncertainty are now reported separately
Remaining blockers: exact SDK actor/generic/overload confirmation, possible later compiler errors, clean Mac test rerun and existing release gates; no additional concrete defect identified by this review
Preservation: all pre-existing Phase 41 work excluded; no AGENTS.md staging, push, CI/workflow execution, or workflow-trigger changes

### 2026-09-05 — M3 Build XCTest root-cause correction

Status: TEST_DEFECT classified before repair; source repair and deterministic regression coverage complete; Mac XCTest confirmation pending
Commit(s): single local checkpoint containing this entry, `checkpoint: correct M3 Build XCTest factory boundary`; investigation parent `180155bedc7d421e3c5ffc391e943a32bffec604`
Files changed: older-factory Build test, two dedicated M3 test files, focused boundary guard and standard-test-audit integration, root-cause document, living plan
Root cause: Gate #6 asserted `.math(.missingValueExpression)` on the generic `MathContentProvider` path, which always emits `.mathExpression`; the canonical dedicated M3 production path already supplies typed prompts
Deterministic coverage: fixed oracle for all six production challenges; all 16 M3 forms and three missing positions; exact generic missing-addend prompt plus full-sequence submission; Windows guard demonstrated rejection before repair and five mutation checks
Validation: all 22 applicable Windows/static audits and a finite-domain source projection; exact results and Phase 41 preservation proof are recorded in the external root-cause export
Mac evidence supplied: Xcode 26.6 / Swift 6.3.3 built all four apps and executed 797 tests, 796 passed; the repaired tests have not run on this Windows host
Product decisions made by user: none; no production or canonical Math changes
Review correction: prior Gate #6 M3 resolution claim was unsupported; no other Gate #6 correction was found to use the same wrong-factory reasoning
Preservation: all 805 pre-existing paths and 408 short-status rows retained; only the seven task files eligible for the local checkpoint; no Phase 41 or AGENTS.md staging
Remaining blockers: future authorized Mac confirmation and existing release gates; no push, fetch, CI, workflow execution or trigger changes

### 2026-09-06 — Language reconstruction unit 1: shell and interface locale

Starting HEAD: 084ca2a3405700fa65841beadd3685ddcaec5d6c. Selective local checkpoint; no push or CI.
Android MainActivity → IntroFragment (IntroScreen.kt) → ButtonsMenuFragment, phone/tablet shell layouts, Parent source/dialog, full wordmark and original opening clip were inspected. The production shell now restores Intro, menu and activity return paths, a compact Parent dialog and canonical activity cards. Existing local settings/progress/rewards are reused.
The Hebrew failure includes English catalog values and eager process-language String lookup. 78 Android-mapped keys, deferred title/name keys, explicit LocalizedStringResource locale lookup, and regression tests/audits address these boundaries. Apple's documentation confirms that the other String initializer's locale argument only formats interpolations.
Windows catalog/policy/test-source/asset/provenance checks and seven negative regression fixtures passed; new XCTest and runtime rendering remain pending. All remaining activities are OPEN in the ledger. The 805-path pre-existing-work snapshot reports zero changes.

### 2026-09-06 - Language reconstruction: Learn, Pairs, choices, Build and Cards

Learn checkpoint 4144910 restores 53 typed cards / 106 original letter forms and the divider. The next source unit rebuilds fixed Pairs/choice/Build compositions, original reaction/star/audio/font assets, typed host Build clues, and actual speech-completion progression. Choice and completed-word rewards preserve Android's distinct local bonus and displayed streak; stale event replay and re-entry are covered. Cards now uses the original full wordmark, inset Play/X, shorter short-word card, larger raised mascot and active-scene presentation timers; the prior explicit default accessibility action is retained.
Validation: focused Pairs/choice/Build negative guards and local test-source/localization/speech/production checks pass; Cards/API/visual guards also pass after following the new shared header; all six historical API-negative fixtures remain rejected. New XCTest is unexecuted on Windows. All 805 pre-existing paths remain unchanged. Full sixteen-reference crosswalk records outstanding source gaps explicitly. No push or CI; complete Language source gate still OPEN.

Bounded recovery review: Android Write exposes Next immediately after a wrong choice while retaining the same challenge for retry, so the iOS choice page now follows `canAdvanceManually` without hiding Next during its transient incorrect state. Rejected Build-letter event IDs are persisted as zero-point, streak-neutral ledger markers, preventing an old event from resetting a newer bonus run after service recreation. Continuous Build uses an independent monotonically increasing presentation identity so a repeated word/token in a later generated batch begins again at attempt 1. The owner contract preserves Learn replay/speech with an attractive triangular Play-style control rather than speaker/Listen treatment. Android Cards source, layouts, and canonical screenshot confirm the visible localized “Cards” heading, which remains.

### 2026-09-06 — Language Picture Memory reconstruction

Picture Memory bounded reconstruction: Android `MemoryGameFragment.kt`, both `fragment_memory_game.xml` layouts, its card/background resources, vocabulary loader/models, strings, dimensions, and reference 10 establish a six-pair fixed 3x4 image-to-identical-image board. The Language-only iOS route now uses the exact decoded Android pastel scene, the original mascot and three blank-back palettes; ordinary phones show all 12 square cards without a board ScrollView, while small/accessibility layouts use the shared deliberate fallback and iPad follows sw600dp scale. Accepted reveals retain exact-once learned speech and existing attempts. The second card starts an identity-guarded one-second evaluation; mismatches close after flip safety, matches remain, stale/lifecycle callbacks cannot touch a later presentation, and completion starts a clean provider-backed round. No generic fraction, manual Continue, mastery/reward UI, or Math presentation change was introduced. Focused Windows audits pass and deterministic XCTest was authored but not run; Xcode, Simulator/device visuals, VoiceOver, Reduce Motion and real audio remain pending. The only remaining reconstruction units are Soccer, Tower, Tic-Tac-Toe, Parent Levels, and the final Mixed/system pass.

### 2026-09-06 — Language Tower / Alphabet Blocks reconstruction

Tower bounded reconstruction: full Android `LettersTowerFragment.kt`, phone/sw600 layouts, reference 11, strings, dimensions, animations, sound/speech paths and all live asset alternatives establish a learned-word target with speaker replay, stable physical letter blocks, an automatically locked first block, correct-next-only bottom-up placement, automatic whitespace spacers, non-consuming wrong choices, final letter then word speech, confetti, fixed +2 completion and continuous words. The Language-only iOS route now reproduces the canonical exact pastel scene, sitting gift mascot, `sand2` and `send_pile`, with loose blocks kept outside a generic grid and the full usable play scene visible together. Typed attempts retain semantic item identity while presentation UUIDs guard exact-once completion and stale delayed transitions. Math Tower remains on its prior value-ordering path. Focused Windows audits pass and deterministic XCTest was authored but not run; Xcode, Simulator/device visuals, VoiceOver, Reduce Motion and real audio remain pending. The remaining OPEN reconstruction units are Soccer, Parent Levels, and the final Mixed/system review.

### 2026-09-06 — Language Tic-Tac-Toe bounded reconstruction

Tic-Tac-Toe bounded reconstruction: the complete live Android `TicTacToeFragment.kt`, four phone/sw600dp regular/Plus layouts, reference 12, game/AI/reset paths, strings, dimensions/colors, assets, speech/sounds, animation timing and lifecycle cleanup establish the child-first continuous just-for-fun game. The dedicated iOS screen now uses the exact decoded pastel scene and actual board-holding Plus mascot instead of the dab substitute, with an inside close, gradient title, X/O choice, status and complete purple/pink/teal-edged white board together without normal-phone scrolling. The existing default-X and retained/unlocked mark selection, A-E/Random/Adaptive mapping, random/established Medium/minimax AI, atomic single AI response, hidden cumulative scores, result timing, speech/audio and cancellation remain unchanged. Focused Windows audits pass and one deterministic stale-new-round XCTest was authored but not run; Xcode, Simulator/device visuals, VoiceOver/Switch Control, Reduce Motion and real audio remain pending. The remaining OPEN reconstruction units are Soccer, Parent Levels, and the final Mixed/system review.

### 2026-09-06 — Language Parent Levels reconstruction

The live Android path `IntroScreen` → `LanguagesAndLevelsDialogFragment` → `LevelsDifficultyDialogFragment` and its shared phone/tablet `dialog_levels_difficulty.xml` establish a compact modal with immediately persisted controls: Auto/manual Words A-E (default Auto at A), Soccer A-C (default A), and Tic-Tac-Toe A-E/Random/Adaptive (default Adaptive). The general word level is per local product/profile rather than per learned language; Manual filters the vocabulary curriculum stage used by production word sessions and does not change the learned language, interface locale, or Math level. The iOS Parent Levels action opens that destination, persists through the Parent settings repository boundary, and exposes it in Plus and fixed-English English Only. Soccer A/B/C and Tic-Tac-Toe have production effects. The follow-up Language Auto unit adds durable per-word/activity/stage evidence, exact Write/Tower/Soccer full-pool thresholds, the persisted two-pass gate, upward-only promotion, and previous/current vocabulary list-count ramp. Auto and Manual share the persisted A-E value exactly as Android does. Xcode/XCTest, phone/iPad rendering, Arabic RTL, VoiceOver and app-restart/background ramp verification remain pending. Status: `ANDROID_PARITY_IMPLEMENTED_SOURCE`; the final Mixed/system review remains OPEN.

### 2026-09-07 — Language Soccer bounded reconstruction

Starting HEAD: `2783566bc4503fa4340dd31905594b513ec47e98`. The complete live Android Soccer game/intro sources, phone/sw600 layouts, strings, dimensions, active assets, and binding references 08/09 were inspected read-only. The Language route now owns a fixed no-scroll field composition and upward drag release. The football follows the measured drag vector at Android's fixed speed/minimum upward component; keeper, posts, crossbar and goal use the same coordinate model; collision rebounds before a shot-ID-gated exact-once finalization. Cancelling below the release threshold produces no attempt or score. Existing ordered-token educational correctness, score matrix, retry/consumption, duplicates, learned speech/replay, continuous words, specialized telemetry and no-Math-field policy remain authoritative.

Persisted Parent Soccer A/B/C now controls Android-derived keeper reference sizes, first stationary/moving attempts, goal-mouth movement range, 3.0/1.1/0.8-second one-way sweep timing and the Android post-ten-shot goal-ratio adjustment/floors. A typed local full-pool exhaustion boundary is exposed for future Auto work without changing the global word-level engine. The first-three-presentation introduction and all 11 Full/10 English Only entries now describe drag; non-English updates remain `needs_review`. Math Soccer and every other activity are unchanged.

Deterministic XCTest source covers release/deadband cancellation, vector goal/miss, keeper/post/crossbar collision/rebound, velocity normalization, lifecycle exclusivity/stale/duplicate callbacks, all A/B/C first-keeper rules, sizes/speeds/adaptive floors/range, unresolved cancellation, and typed pool exhaustion; existing tests retain the complete score/consumption/retry/duplicate/speech/product-policy contracts. Focused and standard Windows audits are recorded in the checkpoint report; XCTest/Xcode/Simulator/device/audio/VoiceOver/RTL/visual and native-language validation remain pending. Global Language Auto is implemented at Windows-static source level; the final Mixed/system audit remains OPEN. No push or CI.

### 2026-09-07 — Android-derived Language Auto A-E progression

Starting HEAD: `3396f12f761b9dd15d9ee831463f5788533021d0`. The complete Android owning path was re-read through Intro/Parent mode storage, per-word counters, level gate, all three eligible activity pool boundaries, promotion/ramp mixing, and `MainActivity.onStop`. iOS Build Word is Android `WriteScreen`'s `Screen.DRAG` path: whole-word completion adds one correct count and rejected-letter retry does not persist a wrong count. Tower and Soccer retain per-letter correct/wrong evidence.

The Language-only state now persists product/profile scope, semantic content identity, originating activity and A-E stage, correct/wrong counters, current shared Parent word level, per-level consecutive passes, ramp, and applied evidence/pool IDs. Write evaluates only after its complete unique pool at 100/90%; Tower and Soccer evaluate only after complete bags at 600/80%. Two consecutive passing pools promote A→B→C→D→E once; failure resets the current-level streak; Manual, E, duplicate, and stale-level pools cannot promote. Counters and streaks survive mode switches/restart as Android does.

Promotion stores the shared Parent A-E value and ramp 90. Pool generation reproduces Android's independently rounded/capped previous/current list counts and shuffle; scene background maps `MainActivity.onStop` to a persisted -10 decay floored at zero. Plus/English Only remain product-isolated, learned language stays independent, and Math is untouched. Deterministic XCTest source covers the required 32 behaviors plus shared-counter/idempotency cases; focused negative/static audits run on Windows, while Xcode/XCTest and real background/restart validation remain pending. Status: `ANDROID_PARITY_IMPLEMENTED_SOURCE`. The remaining source unit is exactly the final Mixed/system review.

### 2026-09-07 — Final Language source parity / Mixed and system review

Starting HEAD: `ead1d811671beda171398220f81fda307cfc1127`. The current production route for all 13 child-visible Language identities, all activity release audits, all 16 canonical Android references, the complete Android Mixed owner path, Parent/settings, Auto, rewards/progress, speech/lifecycle/accessibility, English Only and Math isolation were reconciled without reopening accepted product decisions.

Mixed retains the exact repeating 20 Word-to-Picture / 10 Picture-to-Word / 5 Word Build schedule and activity-specific presentations. The typed session boundary now rejects advance callbacks from replaced child UUIDs as well as stale completion replacements; failed child construction remains atomic. Tests cover two complete cycles and stale callbacks. A typed eligibility mapper makes the existing Auto contract directly testable: only standalone Build completion maps to Android Write, Tower and Soccer attempts map to their own gates, and Mixed/other families return no Auto evidence. Choice/build rewards and `.mixed` telemetry remain unchanged and contain no Math fields.

The Auto audit now states the exact shared-hub architecture: Math currently receives an inert in-memory state load, but does not use, record, evaluate, promote, decay, or persist Language Auto state. Current source review found no remaining discoverable Language Android-parity discrepancy. `LANGUAGE ANDROID PARITY SOURCE GATE: ANDROID_PARITY_IMPLEMENTED_SOURCE`; separately, `RUNTIME_VISUAL_VERIFICATION_PENDING`. This is not release completion: Xcode/XCTest, device rendering and interaction, VoiceOver/Switch Control, RTL/Dynamic Type/Reduce Motion, speech/audio/timing, native-language QA, Phase 41 vocabulary/art, backend/leaderboard/services, commerce/policy/notifications, and TestFlight/App Store gates remain pending. No push or CI.

---

### 2026-09-08 — Phase 41 Android vocabulary asset reconciliation

Starting HEAD: `cdfe99e8e795732fb9f18851679d3103ed2f9876`. The preserved Phase 41 worktree was inspected without mutation. Exactly 397 previously approved `migrate_android` vocabulary rows were recovered as 397 isolated Xcode image sets and reconciled into canonical `main`; unrelated benchmark changes, a README deletion, and other dirty-worktree edits were not transferred. The migration preserves the manifest stable keys and bilingual English/Hebrew content, moves those rows from `missing_ios`/`migrate_android` to `existing_ios`/`reuse_ios`, and leaves the 33 `trusted_acquire` plus 101 `create_new` rows unresolved rather than fabricating art.

The checked-in migration report traces all 397 outputs to the existing Android drawable paths: 395 WebP sources and 2 PNG sources. The Windows-static audit verifies synchronized 543-row manifests, safe/unique identifiers, nonblank English and Hebrew values, source existence and byte counts, source/output dimensions, Xcode catalog references, and successful decoding of all 397 migrated PNGs. There is one byte-identical output pair, `cyan` and `turquoise`; their Android source files are themselves byte-identical, so the audit accepts the shared source provenance rather than treating it as an accidental iOS duplication. Current lifecycle counts are 409 `reuse_ios`, 0 `migrate_android`, 33 `trusted_acquire`, and 101 `create_new`. Xcode asset compilation and device visual review remain pending.

---

### 2026-09-12 — H1/H2 Firebase remote-records source integration

The Language products now link the official Firebase Apple SDK through Swift Package Manager and configure it only when a target-specific `GoogleService-Info.plist` is present. Missing configuration remains a supported source/test state rather than a launch crash. A Firebase anonymous-identity adapter and Firestore data source implement Android's existing app ID `3`, separate Plus/English Only score collections, shared streak collection, top-20 descending queries, legacy `date_achived` spelling, tolerant legacy-field defaults, tie/cutoff rules, same-player overwrite protection, and atomic merge writes. Math and Ping Pong do not link the Firebase products.

The Home trophy now opens a production score/streak leaderboard with loading, retry, not-configured, empty, and Firestore-cache/offline states. Deterministic XCTest source covers mapping, product isolation, ranking, identity/name behavior, and atomic schema writes. Windows source, localization, catalog-parity, test-source, and focused Firebase audits pass; XCTest/Xcode and real backend behavior have not run on Windows. Production Firebase plists, Firestore rules/index deployment, App Check and child-data/privacy review, reward-candidate submission wiring, and macOS/device validation remain release gates.

---

### 2026-09-12 — I1/I2 local learning reminders

First-release reminders are local-only; no FCM or remote-push dependency was introduced. They default off and can request alert/sound permission only after a parent enables the control in Parent Area. The production adapter uses one product-scoped repeating request at a conservative seven-day interval, cancels pending and delivered copies when disabled, repairs a missing opted-in schedule when the app becomes active, and never prompts during lifecycle restoration. Copy is privacy-safe and resolved using Minik's selected interface locale.

Deterministic XCTest source covers product-isolated persistence, cadence, contextual permission, denial, exact-once lifecycle repair, and cancellation. Focused notification, localization/catalog, product-policy, test-source, and diff checks pass on Windows. Real authorization, Settings revocation, delivery/timing, locale changes, and device lifecycle remain pending on macOS/device; the weekly cadence and copy remain explicitly subject to final product approval.

---

### 2026-09-12 — J2/J3 Minik commerce application integration

The existing reusable `AppStoreCommerceKit` package remains unchanged and is now linked into every target that compiles the shared app source. A thin Minik layer loads a per-target `MinikRemoveAdsProductIdentifier` Info value, maps only that non-consumable to the `remove_ads` entitlement, starts exactly one transaction-update listener at app startup, refreshes current entitlements at startup and foreground, supports explicit user restore, and persists only a product-scoped launch cache that is replaced by StoreKit's authoritative state. Missing product configuration leaves the app and Parent Area functional without fabricating an identifier or entitlement.

Parent Area presents StoreKit's localized price, purchase/pending/cancel/error/active states, and restore. Both StoreKit actions first require a randomized grown-up arithmetic gate; no purchase is exposed in a child activity. Deterministic app-layer XCTest source covers configuration, product isolation, startup listening/reconciliation, purchase, pending, update, restore, cache, and gate arithmetic. Focused commerce, localization/catalog, and test-source checks pass on Windows. Production App Store Connect non-consumable IDs, agreements/tax/banking/product metadata, StoreKit sandbox/TestFlight testing, and Xcode compilation remain external gates; the frozen hosted grace-period CI test was not run.

---

### 2026-09-12 — J4 child-directed ad boundary and cadence

Android's current `MyApp`, `InterstitialHelper`, `DeviceStatusManager`, `WriteScreen`, Tower, Picture Memory, Soccer and Tic-Tac-Toe sources were re-read as the shared-system authority. The iOS app now has a provider-neutral interstitial service and a product-scoped persisted policy. It preserves Android's no-first-opportunity behavior, shared `> 2` completion threshold, Picture Memory weight three, 60-second session warm-up, provider two-minute floor, current seven-minute interval and Android's persisted 7→5→4→3-minute background progression. Android WriteScreen opportunities cover standalone Picture→Word, Word→Picture and Build Word plus Mixed advances; Tower, Picture Memory, Soccer and Tic-Tac-Toe report only completed-round boundaries. Math curriculum routes do not inherit Language placement. Ping Pong reports only the existing owner-approved every-second completed-match opportunity.

Every provider configuration is forced to child-directed, under-age-of-consent, G-rated and non-personalized. `remove_ads` suppresses before counters or timestamps mutate. The app defaults ads and policy approval off and requires externally injected provider application/interstitial identifiers. No provider SDK was selected: until the App Store category/age band and a policy-compatible provider are approved, the production composition uses a no-op service and cannot display an ad. Deterministic XCTest source covers fail-closed configuration, safety flags, cadence/weights/warm-up, entitlement suppression, persistence, provider outcomes and the background interval floor. Focused ad, localization/catalog, English Only and test-source audits pass on Windows; XCTest/Xcode and real provider/device behavior remain pending.

---

### 2026-09-12 — J5 / Parent release-source completion

The Android Remove Ads reminder's exact durable timing contract is now represented: two days from first app observation, fourteen days after every presentation, one presentation per process session, immediate suppression for the permanent opt-out or Remove Ads entitlement, and no reminder unless both a real ad provider and a loaded StoreKit product are available. Deferral is persisted when the reminder appears so closing the sheet cannot create repeat spam. Its purchase action reuses the existing grown-up arithmetic gate and StoreKit controller.

Parent Area now exposes configurable HTTPS-only Privacy Policy, Terms of Use and Support destinations behind the same grown-up gate, optional configured legal notice content, and bundle marketing/build version. Empty or invalid external values remain visibly unavailable instead of falling back to invented URLs. Both catalogs validate at 561 keys across the existing 11 Full and 10 English Only locales; new non-English source fallbacks remain `needs_review`. Focused Parent/release, commerce, ads, localization/catalog, English Only and test-source audits pass on Windows. Xcode/XCTest, real external-link handoff, StoreKit, reminder presentation and accessibility/device review remain pending.

---

### 2026-09-12 — B5/H5 production reward coverage

The complete 13-route production Language inventory was compared with the Android reward reference and existing iOS event boundaries. Previously integrated choice/Build, Letter Pairs and Tower rules remain unchanged. The three documented source gaps are now wired: Picture Memory awards Android's fixed +2 per completed game without changing streak; Soccer awards +3 for a child win, +1 for a draw and no points for a loss; Tic-Tac-Toe awards +2/+1/-1 with the shared zero floor. Soccer and Tic-Tac-Toe emit typed final outcomes, and all new mappings reject Math and Ping Pong products.

On exit from a production Language activity, the current product-scoped aggregate points and best streak are submitted through the existing Android-compatible remote-record repository when Firebase is configured. Zero state, absent configuration and remote errors fail closed without changing local rewards. No Math reward values were invented, and Ping Pong remains without a reward policy because the inspected Android product has none. Deterministic XCTest source and a 13-route Windows audit were added; Xcode/XCTest, real Firestore writes, identity/name UX and new-record presentation remain pending.

---

### 2026-09-12 - N4/O1 release-configuration scaffolding

`project.yml` now exposes independent bundle-identifier overrides for all four applications and the test bundle, plus shared marketing/build version inputs and a final-app-icon name hook. The two Language targets accept an external `MINIK_FIREBASE_PLIST_PATH`; an empty setting remains compile-safe, while a configured build validates and copies that target's plist without committing account configuration. Final icons are not present and remain an explicit external asset rather than a fabricated placeholder.

Every application target now includes an app-owned privacy manifest. Language declares no tracking, app-only `UserDefaults` access using reason `CA92.1`, and the anonymous identity/gameplay record data sent by the current Firebase adapter for app functionality. Math and Ping Pong declare the same app-only defaults reason with no app-owned off-device collection. The source inventory found no implemented capability requiring an entitlement file; final signing, bundle IDs, icons, Firebase plists/App Check/backend rules, StoreKit/ad identifiers, public legal URLs, privacy decisions and App Store metadata remain external gates. `docs/release-configuration.md` is the configuration handoff, and the focused Windows audit validates the checked-in hooks and manifests. XcodeGen generation, archive privacy report, signing, macOS builds/tests and device/TestFlight validation have not run in this Windows unit.

---

### 2026-09-13 — Phase 41 vocabulary source-asset closure

The final 93 `create_new` vocabulary concepts were generated individually from the reviewed production queue and prompt-cell briefs. All outputs were visually inspected in labeled contact sheets; `snack_bar` intentionally remains the Android/Hebrew snack-counter sense (`מזנון`), and the potentially confusable Label, Museum Guide, Tour Guide, Ticket, Boarding Pass and Platform concepts retain their explicit visual distinctions. No vocabulary text, level, category, stable key, asset key, sampling rule, or activity behavior changed.

The generated importer records exact generation output IDs, prompt sources/sections, review dates, byte counts, SHA-256 hashes, decoded dimensions and actual alpha extrema, then copies byte-identical masters into isolated Xcode imagesets. The strengthened audit independently validates all 93 generated PNGs, the complete 543-row manifest, source/output provenance, unique generated hashes/output IDs, catalog references, and zero remaining `create_new`, `trusted_acquire`, or Android migration rows. Windows-static and visual-review gates pass. Xcode asset compilation, iPhone/iPad rendering and scale, VoiceOver context, native-language QA, TestFlight, and final human art-direction acceptance remain pending.

---

### 2026-09-13 — A2 GitHub-hosted four-product Simulator smoke gate

Status: completed at workflow/static level; first authorized manual macOS execution pending

Commit(s): checkpoint containing this entry, `checkpoint: add GitHub Simulator smoke gate`

Files changed: existing manual iOS Simulator workflow, deterministic workflow contract audit, Current Active Phase, Decision Log, and this Sprint Log entry

Tests run: directory-wide `.yml`/`.yaml` trigger audit; complete four-product/build-package/XCTest/runtime/artifact/final-verdict contract audit; Bash syntax parsing for all embedded workflow scripts; Python syntax parsing for both embedded evidence helpers; `git diff --check` and complete staged-diff review

Mac validation: not run. The next explicitly authorized manual dispatch must prove all four Xcode builds/packages, the single ProductConfigurationTests invocation, modern iPhone Simulator selection/boot, derived bundle identifiers, sequential install/launch/process survival/screenshots/logs/termination, crash collection, JSON summary, partial-success artifacts, and aggregate failure behavior.

Product decisions made by user: GitHub Actions only; no external validation service; manual dispatch only; mandatory complete four-product gate; one compile-gated XCTest pass; unsigned credential-free Simulator validation; no hosted AppStoreCommerceKit grace-period test; three-day evidence retention.

Reviewer result: workflow and Windows-static contract are prepared for review; no push or GitHub Actions run occurred, and no runtime success is claimed.

---

### 2026-09-13 — B5/H1–H5 public leaderboard privacy model

Status: completed at source/Windows-static level; macOS, deployed Firebase, device UX, and owner/legal review pending

Commit(s): checkpoint containing this entry, `checkpoint: implement public leaderboard privacy`

Files changed: typed curated alias and local state; consent-aware record submission/deletion; Firebase composition; child alias/pending UX; gated Parent disclosure/control/deletion UX; sanitized leaderboard presentation; deterministic tests; localization catalogs/sync; focused audit; release/privacy documentation and Living Status

Tests run: focused remote-records privacy audit; localization source/catalog audit; 592-key catalog validation for 11 Full and 10 English Only locales; reward-coverage, product-test-source and release-configuration audits; complete deterministic Windows audit/validator suite; `git diff --check`; complete staged-diff review

Mac/backend validation: not run. Xcode compilation/XCTest, production Firebase configuration, deployed rules/index/App Check enforcement, anonymous-auth lifecycle, real write/retry/delete behavior, child/Parent device UX, accessibility, and archive privacy reporting remain pending.

Product decisions made by user: the complete public leaderboard privacy decision recorded in the 2026-09-13 Decision Log entry

Reviewer result: source enforces no local-name path, no upload before persisted Parent approval, local best-candidate staging, stable curated alias reuse, immediate upload disable, and participant-scoped public deletion without local-progress mutation; legal text and backend policy remain explicit release gates.

---

### 2026-09-13 — B5/H1–H5 leaderboard alias activation adjustment

Status: completed at source/Windows-static level; macOS, deployed Firebase, device UX, and owner/legal review pending

Commit(s): checkpoint containing this entry, `checkpoint: remove mandatory leaderboard approval`

Files changed: participation preference/state and record-submission result names; immediate publish after first curated alias selection; direct Parent On/Off and deletion controls; deterministic privacy tests; localization catalogs/sync; focused audit; release/privacy documentation and Living Status

Tests run: focused remote-records privacy audit; localization source/catalog audit and catalog validation; reward-coverage, product-test-source and release-configuration audits; complete deterministic Windows audit/validator suite; `git diff --check`; complete staged-diff review

Mac/backend validation: not run. Xcode compilation/XCTest, production Firebase configuration, deployed rules/index/App Check enforcement, anonymous-auth lifecycle, real write/retry/delete behavior, child/Parent device UX, accessibility, and archive privacy reporting remain pending.

Product decisions made by user: the superseding public leaderboard alias-activation decision recorded in the 2026-09-13 Decision Log entry

Reviewer result: source enforces no remote access before curated alias selection, immediate pending publication after normal alias selection, no local-name/free-text path, stable alias reuse, persistent Parent opt-out, and participant-scoped deletion without local-progress mutation; legal text and backend policy remain explicit release gates.

---

### 2026-09-13 — O1 canonical Apple bundle-ID migration

Status: completed at source/Windows-static level; external registration, signing, Xcode generation, macOS builds/tests, and archives remain pending

Commit(s): checkpoint containing this entry, `checkpoint: migrate canonical Apple bundle identifiers`

Files changed: `project.yml` canonical defaults for four apps and test bundle; release audit forbidden-ID enforcement; README and release-configuration handoff; Living Status, Decision Log, and Sprint Log

Tests run: complete 37-entry Windows audit/validator suite; focused release audit requiring all five canonical identifiers and rejecting old/temporary identifiers in shipping Apple configuration; repository identifier inventory; `git diff --check`; complete staged-diff review

Mac validation: not run. XcodeGen-generated Info.plists, resulting `CFBundleIdentifier` values, unsigned Simulator builds/tests/smoke evidence, signing, archives, and App Store configuration remain pending.

Product decisions made by user: the five canonical production Apple identifiers recorded in the 2026-09-13 Decision Log entry; Android IDs and `remove_ads` remain unchanged

Remaining blockers: Apple Developer/App Store Connect registrations, matching Language Firebase Apple app registrations/plists, any approved AdMob iOS app registrations/IDs, signing, and macOS/archive validation

Reviewer result: prepared for review; no push, CI, or GitHub Actions run occurred

---

### 2026-09-13 — H1/O1 production Firebase plist wiring

Status: completed at source/Windows-static level; macOS build/runtime and deployed-backend validation remain pending

Commit(s): checkpoint containing this entry, `checkpoint: wire production Firebase Apple configuration`

Files changed: two target-specific production Apple Firebase plists; exact Language target paths and pre-copy `BUNDLE_ID` validation in `project.yml`; narrow ignore exceptions; deterministic release audit; release handoff and Living Status

Tests run: plist XML/bundle-ID inspection without credential output; target-path/isolation and single-initialization source inspection; complete 37-entry Windows audit/validator suite; `git diff --check`; complete staged-diff review

Mac/backend validation: not run. XcodeGen generation, plist copy phases, built-app resource inspection, Firebase initialization/authentication, Firestore rules/index/App Check behavior, all four builds, ProductConfigurationTests, Simulator smoke, signing, and archives remain pending.

Product decisions made by user: none; the previously confirmed canonical Language bundle-ID mappings were applied

Remaining blockers: Firebase Console/API restriction and deployed backend verification, App Check, legal/privacy approval, macOS/runtime validation, signing, and App Store release work

Reviewer result: prepared for review; Math/Ping Pong remain Firebase-free, Android configuration is untouched, and no push or GitHub Actions run occurred

---

### 2026-09-13 — H1 Firebase contract, Auth, App Check, and Rules readiness

Status: completed at source/Windows-static level; coordinated identity migration, deployment, macOS/runtime, and backend validation remain pending

Commit(s): `8000d0201c9782e5da1fad3fe245c544b5a14ab1` (`checkpoint: harden Firebase leaderboard readiness`)

Files changed: Android-derived cross-platform contract fixture and documentation; auth-gated iOS remote data source; anonymous UID/App Check bootstrap; Release App Attest entitlement; strict migration-target Firestore Rules/indexes/firebase configuration; deterministic remote-record tests and focused audits; release handoff and Living Status

Tests run: focused Firebase/remote-records/release/test-source Windows audits and `git diff --check`. XCTest was authored but not executed because no Swift/macOS toolchain is available on this Windows host.

Mac/backend validation: not run. The strict Rules were not deployed. Android production generates profile `player_id` independently of anonymous Auth and accepts legacy free-text `user_name`; current iOS also preserves a product/profile UUID. Secure `auth.uid` ownership therefore requires a coordinated Android/iOS identity and alias migration before Rules deployment.

Product decisions made by user: none

Remaining blockers: Firebase Anonymous Auth console enablement; coordinated participant/alias migration; rules/index deployment only after emulator testing; Apple/Android App Check registration and metrics; legal/privacy approval; macOS/device/backend validation

Reviewer result: source configuration is fail-closed, the migration/security consequence is explicit, and no backend deploy, push, CI, or GitHub Actions run occurred

---

### 2026-09-13 — N/O final Windows release-source closure

Status: all independently completable repository release preparation in this bounded pass is complete; Mac/Xcode runtime validation and owner console/legal actions remain

Commit(s): checkpoint containing this entry, `checkpoint: complete release source closure`

Files changed: known Google sample/test-ID rejection and deterministic test/audit; exact website privacy replacement, App Store privacy-data inventory, four-product Apple/Firebase/AdMob checklist, and expanded release handoff; explicit accessibility target fixes for Parent/Progress/Records controls; narrow accessibility/release-closure audits; Living Status and this Sprint Log

Tests run: complete 40-entry Windows audit/validator suite, focused new audits, `git diff --check`, staged checks, and complete staged-diff review. XCTest source was not executed because this host has no Swift/macOS toolchain.

Mac/backend validation: not run. Xcode generation/build/test, app launches, device App Attest/Auth/Firestore, StoreKit, ads, notification delivery, accessibility/runtime visual QA, archives/privacy reports, signing, TestFlight, and App Store submission remain pending.

Product decisions made by user: none; unresolved Kids/category, advertising enablement, privacy/legal classification, notification copy/cadence, and standalone Ping Pong commerce remain owner decisions

Remaining blockers: exact classified owner-console, legal/policy, and Mac actions are recorded in `docs/apple-release-checklist.md`; website privacy wording still requires approval/publication

Reviewer result: tracked source is prepared for the remaining external/runtime gates; the oversized pre-existing untracked rollout JSONL is untouched; no push, deploy, CI, hosted StoreKit test, or GitHub Actions run occurred

### 2026-09-14 — H1 secure multi-profile leaderboard ownership closure

Status: completed for canonical iOS source, Firestore Rules/configuration, deterministic Windows coverage, and migration handoff; Android implementation, administrator cutover, deployment, and runtime validation remain external

Commit(s): checkpoint containing this entry, `checkpoint: secure multi-profile leaderboard ownership`

Files changed: versioned per-product/profile participant identity; authenticated private ownership claim composition; ownership-gated record write/delete; strict ownership/public-schema Rules and contract fixture; secure migration runbook with exact Android file handoff; Parent curated change-alias control; privacy/release/Apple handoffs; deterministic tests/audits; Living Status and Decision Log

Tests run: complete 40-entry Windows audit/validator suite, focused Firebase/records/privacy/release/localization/test-source audits, JSON/XML validation, `git diff --check`, cached checks, and complete staged-diff review. XCTest source was authored but not executed because this Windows host has no Swift/macOS toolchain; Firebase Rules emulator execution remains an owner/backend prerequisite.

Mac/backend validation: not run. No Rules/index deployment, live-data read/write/delete, Auth/App Check console change, GitHub Actions, Xcode build/test, Simulator/device run, StoreKit host test, or external CI occurred.

Product decisions made by user: Firebase `auth.uid` must remain distinct from per-profile `player_id`; one UID may own multiple profile IDs; legacy IDs cannot be client-claimed; selected migration is administrator archive/verify/clear followed by strict Rules and coordinated updated clients

Remaining blockers: updated Android implementation in its owning read-only repository; Firebase Anonymous Auth and App Check registration; Rules Emulator Suite verification; administrator archive/clear/deploy cutover; policy/legal approval; macOS/device/backend runtime validation

Reviewer result: canonical iOS main is source-closed for this ownership model; the oversized pre-existing rollout JSONL and every Android reference file remain untouched; no push, deploy, CI, or hosted workflow occurred

## 2026-09-28 — Modern Ping Pong port, source implementation / pending Mac verification

Writable project: `C:\Projects\Minik-to-IOS\ios-main-merge`. Android reference: `C:\Projects\MinikPingPong` (read-only). New native engine/UI/services and current Android assets; scoped standalone root, target dependency/resource, audit and privacy handoff changes. Full/Simple capability boundary and host completion callback are implemented. Firebase Apple app `1:12298786440:ios:bfc268456a87978e75f13d` created for the existing `minikswish` backend. No production RTDB deployment/data edits, Git mutation, Pixels or ADB.

Validation: 43/43 isolated RTDB emulator tests pass; 152 Android/profile/asset/config source checks pass; staged Swift grammar parse passes; existing ads/commerce/release/product-configuration audits pass. Twenty-five focused XCTest methods were authored but cannot execute without Apple tooling. These checks are not a native build or proof of runtime parity. Release remains blocked on the documented Mac/iOS validation and App Store/production ads setup. Exact inventory and evidence: `docs/modern-pong-ios-handoff.md` and `docs/modern-pong-changes.json`.

## 2026-09-28 — Retro parity and shared Math/standalone entry

Status: implemented at source/Windows-check level; Apple build and runtime gates remain open.

Commits: repaired the moved iOS worktree link; Modern `b15717f`; following Retro commit titled `Share current Android 80s Pong gameplay across iOS Math and standalone`. Branch `main`, no push. Pre-existing untracked ZIP/oversized rollout excluded.

Files: exact inventory `docs/retro-pong-changes.json`; 73 provenance entries in `docs/retro-pong-android-provenance.json`. Shared bundled web engine/assets, narrow native lifecycle/storage/navigation host, Math chooser, new Retro target/icon, focused regression tests/audit and manual-only Apple workflow. Android, Firebase and existing Math curriculum/progress remain untouched.

Validation: 16 imported-engine checks, 7 JS bridge tests, 191 Retro checks, 152 existing Modern checks, four existing PowerShell audits pass; six Swift files grammar-parse without errors. Seven new XCTest methods authored, not run. Logs in `docs/retro-pong-evidence/windows-checks.json`. No native compilation, simulator, screenshots, physical device, StoreKit, ads runtime or live multiplayer verification; no available browser; no devices used.

Remaining: owner push/manual Apple workflow, iPhone/iPad English/Hebrew layouts and gameplay/audio/lifecycle, new standalone Apple registration/signing, and Modern’s separately recorded runtime gates. No Retro ads added; existing Modern test ads unchanged.

# PART XII — FUTURE SESSION BOOTSTRAP INSTRUCTIONS

A new ChatGPT or Codex session should be given this file and instructed:

> Read `ios/docs/MINIK_MASTER_PLAN.md` and `ios/docs/math-production-matrix.md` completely before proposing or editing production code. Treat CANONICAL PRODUCT CONTRACT sections as authoritative. Android is the reference for Language/shared Android behavior; there is no Android Math product. Math requirements come from the approved Math sections and user decisions. Inspect `AGENTS.md`, `ios/docs/android-known-fixes.md`, `ios/docs/reference/android-ui/README.md` and its 16 screenshots, `git status`, `git log`, recent commits affecting the feature, and the actual current contents of every file to be modified. Current newer behavior is authoritative unless an explicit user decision supersedes it; preserve features such as Tower speaker/replay and record newly approved behavior here instead of reverting it. Do not infer completion from enum counts or routes. Work one approved sprint at a time to its Definition of Done. After implementation, update only the Living Status, Decision Log (only for explicit user decisions), and Sprint Log without deleting product explanations. Never claim tests ran when they did not. ChatGPT/reviewer must inspect actual diffs/code before moving to the next sprint.

---

# PART XIII — REQUIRED DOCUMENT MAINTENANCE RULE

At the end of every approved sprint, Codex must:

1. update the sprint status marker;
2. update Current Active Phase;
3. append the Sprint Log entry;
4. append Decision Log only if the user made a new explicit product decision;
5. update the current commit/branch snapshot when material;
6. update completion estimate only after a major phase, not cosmetically;
7. never remove or summarize away the Android/product descriptions merely to shorten the file;
8. never mark an activity “complete” unless it meets the Definition of Done or the log clearly labels the remaining release blockers.

This document is intended to grow with the project. Its purpose is continuity, not brevity.

# APPLE REFERENCES CHECKED FOR THIS PLAN (2026-08-30)

Re-verify immediately before monetization/release implementation because policies/APIs can change:

- Apple App Review Guidelines: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/
- Apple Kids guidance: https://developer.apple.com/kids/
- StoreKit `Transaction.currentEntitlements`: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/currententitlements
